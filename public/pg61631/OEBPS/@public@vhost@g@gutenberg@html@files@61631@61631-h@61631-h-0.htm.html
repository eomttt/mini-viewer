<h2 id="pgepubid00002">A WORD FROM THE WRITER TO THE READER:</h2>
<p class="center">"Those who know will not tell; those who tell do not know."</p>
<p>The old saying applies to woman in to-day's literature. Women writers when they write of women, evade and conceal and palliate. Ancestral reticences, sex loyalties, dissuade the pen.</p>
<p>Men writers when they write of women, do so without comprehension. Men understand women only as women choose to have them, with one exception, the family physician. He knows. He sees through the body to the soul. But he may not tell what he sees. Professional honour binds him. Only through the unaccustomed medium of fiction and out of the vatic incense-cloud of pseudonymity may he speak the truth. Being a physician, I must conceal my identity, and, not less securely, the identity of those whom I picture.</p>
<p>There is no such suburb as Dorrisdale ... and there are a score of Dorrisdales. There is no such family as the Fentrisses ... and there are a thousand Fentriss families. For the delineation which I have striven to present, honestly and unreservedly, of the twentieth century woman of the luxury-class I beg only the indulgence permissible to a neophyte's pen. I have no other apologia to offer.</p>
<p>To the woman of the period thus set forth, restless, seductive, greedy, discontented, craving sensation, unrestrained, a little morbid, more than a little selfish, intelligent, uneducated, sybaritic, following blind instincts and perverse fancies, slack of mind as she is trim of body, neurotic and vigorous, a worshipper of tinsel gods at perfumed altars, fit mate for the hurried, reckless and cynical man of the age, predestined mother of—what manner of being?: To Her I dedicate this study of herself.</p>

<p class="bold2">FLAMING YOUTH</p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00004">PART I</h2>
<h2 id="pgepubid00005">CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The room was vital with air and fresh with the scent of many flowers. It was a happy room, a loved room, even a petted room. There was about it a sense of stir, of life, of habitual holiday. Some rooms retain these echoes. People say of them that they have character or express individuality. But this one's character was composite, possessing attributes of the many who had come and gone and laughed and played and perhaps loved there, at the behest of its mistress. A captious critic might have complained that it was over-crowded. The same critic might have said the same of Mona Fentriss's life.</p>
<p>Though a chiefly contributory part of the room's atmosphere, Mona Fentriss's personality was not fully reflected in her immediate environment. The room was not a married room. It suggested none of the staidness, the habitude, the even acceptances of conjugal life. The bed stood outside, on the sleeping porch. It was a single bed. Unfriendly commentators upon the Fentriss ménage had been known to express the conviction that marriage was not a specially important element in Mrs. Fentriss's joyous existence. Nevertheless there were the three children, all girls. There was also Fentriss.</p>
<p>The mistress of the room lolled on a cushioned chaise longue near the side window. She was a golden-brown, strong, delicately rounded woman, glowing with an effect<a id="Page_8" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 8]"></a> of triumphant and imperishable youth. Not one of her features but was faulty by strict artistic tenets; even the lustrous eyes were set at slightly different levels. Yet the total effect was that of loveliness; yes, more, of compelling charm. One would have guessed her to be still short of thirty.</p>
<p>"This is final, is it?" she asked evenly of a man who was standing near the door.</p>
<p>"It's final enough," he answered.</p>
<p>He shambled across the room to her side, moving like a bear. Like a bear's his exterior was rough, shaggy, and seemed not to fit him well. His face was irregularly square, homely, thoughtful, and humorous. "Want to cry?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No. I want to swear."</p>
<p>"Go ahead."</p>
<p>Downstairs a door opened and closed. There followed the rhythmic crepitation of ice against metal.</p>
<p>"There's Ralph home," interpreted the wife. "Call down and tell him to shake up one for me."</p>
<p>"Better not."</p>
<p>"Oh, you be damned!" she retorted, twinkling at him. "You've finished your day's job as a physician. I need one."</p>
<p>As he obediently went out she mused, with the instinct of the competent housekeeper:</p>
<p>"Gin's gone to twenty-five dollars a gallon. That'll rasp poor old Ralph. I wonder how much this will jar him." By "this" she meant the news which she had just forced from the reluctant lips of Dr. Robert Osterhout. She pursued her line of thought. "Who'll take over the house? The girls know nothing about running it. Perhaps he'll marry again. He's very young for fifty."</p>
<p>The two men entered, Fentriss carrying the shaker.<a id="Page_9" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 9]"></a> He set it down, crossed the room and kissed his wife. There was an effect of habitual and well-bred gallantry in the act. He was a slender, alert, companionable looking man with a quizzical expression. Dr. Osterhout poured out a cocktail which he offered to Mrs. Fentriss. She regarded it contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Bob, you devil! That's only half a drink."</p>
<p>"It's more than you ought to have."</p>
<p>"Pour me a real one. At once! Ralph; <i>you</i> do it. Come on."</p>
<p>With a shrug and a deprecatory smile at the physician, Ralph Fentriss filled the glass to the brim. The Fentriss cocktails were famous far beyond the suburban limits of Dorrisdale for length as well as flavour.</p>
<p>"Here's to Prohibition," said their concoctor in his suave voice, before drinking; "and to your better health, my dear."</p>
<p>"A toi," she responded carelessly. "Leave the shaker, will you, Ralph? Bob and I are talking."</p>
<p>Fentriss nodded and went. A moment later the concert grand in the big living room below stairs responded to a touch at once delicate, strong and distinctive.</p>
<p>"How I used to love his music!" said Mona Fentriss half to herself; "and still do," she added. "Bob." She turned upon her physician with laughing reproach in her eyes. "Don't you know better, after all these years, than to try to keep me from doing anything I want to do? I always get what I want."</p>
<p>"If you don't, it's not for lack of trying."</p>
<p>"I don't even have to try very hard. Life has been a generous godfather to me. But I've always wanted more. Like Oliver Twist, wasn't it? Or Jephthah's daughter?"</p>
<p>Dr. Osterhout grinned. "It was the horse leech's daughters that were always crying 'Give! Give!'"</p>
<p><a id="Page_10" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 10]"></a></p>
<p>"Why cry for it? Reach out and help yourself," she said gaily. "Them's my principles. And now the fairy godfather is going to cut me off with a shilling. Or a year. Or less."</p>
<p>"Unless you obey orders it'll be considerably less."</p>
<p>"Let it! I'd rather do as I please while it lasts.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div>"'I've taken my fun where I found it,</div>
<div>I've rogued and I've ranged in my time,'"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>sang Ralph Fentriss at the piano below to music of his own composing.</p>
<p>"So have I," murmured his wife. Her eyes grew brilliant, craving, excited as they wandered to the flower-decked mantel upon which stood half a dozen photographs. All were of men. Though they varied in age and indications of character, they presented a typical similarity in being well-groomed and attractive. They might all have belonged to the same club. "Bob, do many women confess to their doctors?"</p>
<p>"Lots."</p>
<p>"To you?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't let 'em."</p>
<p>"Why not? I should think it would be interesting."</p>
<p>"It's only a trick to gratify the senses through recollection," said the blunt physician. "Reflected lechery."</p>
<p>"You know too much, Bob. Then you won't be my father confessor?"</p>
<p>"I doubt if you could tell me much," he said slowly.</p>
<p>A smile, unabashed and mischievous, played upon her lips. "That's an ambiguous sort of answer. Sometimes I suspect that very little gets past you."</p>
<p>"I'm trained to observation," he remarked.</p>
<p>"And to silence. So you're safe. I think it would do<a id="Page_11" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 11]"></a> me good to confess to you." She grew still and pensive. "Bob, if I'd been a Roman Catholic do you suppose I'd have been—different?"</p>
<p>"Doubted. Would you want to be?"</p>
<p>"I don't really know that I would. Anyway I'm what I had to be. We all are."</p>
<p>"Fatalism is a convenient excuse."</p>
<p>"No; but I am," she insisted. "It's temperament. Temperament is fate. For a woman, anyway," she added with a flash of insight. "You don't blame me, do you? I couldn't help it, could I?"</p>
<p>He smiled down at her, tolerant but uncompromising.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't stand there looking like God," she fretted. "Do you know what I'd resolved to do? Will you laugh at me if I tell you?"</p>
<p>"Probably. Therefore tell me."</p>
<p>"I was going to be a pattern of all the proprieties after I turned forty."</p>
<p>"Too early," he pronounced judicially.</p>
<p>"Why? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Make it fifty."</p>
<p>She knit her smooth forehead. "Because I wouldn't be pretty then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you'd charm and attract men at seventy. But you wouldn't have such a—well, such an urgent temperament. That passes, usually."</p>
<p>"Bob! You beast!" But she laughed. "You're very much the medical man, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"It's my business in life."</p>
<p>"Well, the whole discussion is what you call an academic question, anyhow. If you and your hateful medical science are right, I'll never see thirty-eight, let alone forty. I don't feel thirty-seven. There's so much life in me. Too much, I suppose."</p>
<p><a id="Page_12" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 12]"></a></p>
<p>"No. Not too much."</p>
<p>"No more flutters for pretty Mona," she mused. "At least she's had her share. Do you think Ralph cares?"</p>
<p>"You're the one to know that."</p>
<p>"If he does, he's never given any sign. But then, it's years since he's been true to me."</p>
<p>Her companion made a slight, uninterpretable gesture.</p>
<p>"Shall I tell him? Your verdict, I mean."</p>
<p>"Great Judas, no! Why stir him up? It's going to be hard enough on him anyway."</p>
<p>"Is it?" she said wistfully. "He'll miss me in a way, won't he? I <i>am</i> fond of him, too, you know."</p>
<p>"Yes. I understand that."</p>
<p>"But you don't understand why I've gone trouble-hunting, out of bounds."</p>
<p>"Yes. I understand that, too."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you do. You understand lots more than one would think from your dear, old, stupid face." She paused. "Tell me something, honestly, Bob. Has there been much talk about me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there's always talk and always will be about anyone as brilliant and vivid as you."</p>
<p>"Don't evade. Some of the older crowd look at me as if they thought I was the Scarlet Woman come back to life. I'm <i>not</i> the Scarlet Woman, Bob. Only a dash of pink."</p>
<p>He smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>"It's strange," she mused, "how the tradition of behaviour clings in the blood, in that set. Your set, Bob. Ah, well! Discretion is the better part of virtue, as someone said. And I haven't been discreet, even if I have been virtuous. You believe I've been, don't you, Bob?"</p>
<p>"What, discreet?"</p>
<p><a id="Page_13" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 13]"></a></p>
<p>Again she laughed, showing little, even, animal-like teeth.</p>
<p>"No; the other thing."</p>
<p>"I believe whatever you want me to."</p>
<p>"Meaning that you reserve your own opinion. But you're a staunch friend, anyway.... The trouble with me is that I was born too soon. I really belong with this wild young age that's coming on the stage just as I'm going off; with the girls. Listen!"</p>
<p>Below stairs Fentriss, still at the piano, had swung into the rhythms of the Second Rhapsody, wild and broken as white water seething through a rock-beset gorge.</p>
<p>"That's the measure they dance to, the new generation. Doesn't it get into your torpid blood, Bob? Don't you wish you were young again? To be a desperado of twenty! They're all desperadoes, these kids, all of them with any life in their veins; the girls as well as the boys; maybe more than the boys. Even Connie with her eyes of a vestal. Ah!"</p>
<p>A new note had merged with the music, a hoarse, childish croon, following the mad measure with an interwoven recitative.</p>
<p>"That's Patricia. She's dancing to it."</p>
<p>"How can you tell?" asked the physician.</p>
<p>"By the way she's singing. Little devil! I wonder what it'll be like by the time she's grown up," mused the mother.</p>
<p>"Which won't be so long, now."</p>
<p>"So it won't. I keep forgetting that. She seems such a baby. What a queer little creature it is, Bob!"</p>
<p>"She's a terror. But there's something lovable about her, too. A touch of you in her, Mona."</p>
<p>"Of me? She's no more like me than I'm like my namesake of the well-known Lisa family. Nor like the older<a id="Page_14" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 14]"></a> girls, either. Well, why shouldn't she be different from them? Coming five years after I'd supposed all that sort of thing was over. She was pure accident. How I tried to get out of having her! Perhaps that's why she's such a strange little elf. But Ralph's crazy about her—as much as he can be crazy about anything. I thought for a time she'd bring us together again."</p>
<p>"But you found variety more amusing than pure domesticity," suggested the physician.</p>
<p>"I? It wasn't I that began it; it was Ralph. You know I never went in for even the mildest flirtation until long after Pat was born; until I began to get bored with the sameness of life."</p>
<p>"Boredom leads more women astray than passion," pronounced the other oracularly; "in our set, anyway."</p>
<p>"Oh, astray," she fretted. "Don't use mid-Victorian pulpit language."</p>
<p>"I was only philosophising about our lot in general."</p>
<p>"We're a pretty rotten lot, aren't we! Though I suppose the people you don't know, the people that nobody knows, are just as rotten. Ah, well, so long as one preserves appearances! And Ralph has no kick coming. He'd gone on the loose before I ever looked sidewise at any other man. They say he's got a Floozie now, tucked away in a cozy corner somewhere."</p>
<p>"Do they?"</p>
<p>"Has he?"</p>
<p>"Ask him."</p>
<p>"Too good a sport," she retorted. "I shouldn't be asking you if I thought you'd tell me. Very likely you don't know. <i>He</i> hasn't been boring you with confessions, I'll bet! Men don't, do they?"</p>
<p>"Only of their symptoms."</p>
<p>"But they confess to women."</p>
<p><a id="Page_15" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 15]"></a></p>
<p>"The more fools they!"</p>
<p>"Can't I wring a confession out of you?" she teased. "Why haven't you ever made love to me, Bob?"</p>
<p>"Too much afraid of losing what little I've got of you," he returned sombrely.</p>
<p>"How do you know you wouldn't have got more? How do you know that I wouldn't have given you—everything?"</p>
<p>"Everything you could give wouldn't be enough."</p>
<p>"Pig! You don't want much, do you!"</p>
<p>"Have you ever really cared for any of your partners in flirtation?"</p>
<p>"You speak as if I'd had dozens," she pouted.</p>
<p>"It isn't a question of the quantity but of the quality of your attachments. If I'd ever asked anything of you it would have been—well, romance." He laughed quietly at himself. "Something you haven't got to give. You see, I'm a romantic and you're not. You've sought excitement, admiration, change. But not 'the light that never was on land or sea.' You're adventurous and passionate, but not romantic. It's quite a different order of thing."</p>
<p>"And you're brutal. Besides, you're wrong; quite wrong."</p>
<p>"Am I?" His glance ranged the faces on the mantel. "Which one?"</p>
<p>She gave him a swift smile. "He isn't there. You never saw him. His name was Cary Scott."</p>
<p>"Was? Is he dead?"</p>
<p>"He's out of my life; or almost. He's married. He was hardly more than a boy when I knew him. Nine years ago in Paris. He was studying at the Polytechnique, doing his post-graduate work and doing it brilliantly, I believe. He went mad over me. My fault; I meant him<a id="Page_16" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 16]"></a> to; it amused me. I was attracted, too. There was a vividness of youth about him. I didn't realise how much I was going to miss him out of my life, though, until we came back. I did miss him. Like hell!"</p>
<p>"He was the one to whom you really gave?"</p>
<p>"Hardly so much as a kiss. I wanted to keep it that way, and he was slave to me. He was an innocent sort of soul, I think. Every year he sends me a card on my birthday—that was the date of our first meeting—to remind me that sometime we are to take up our friendship again. I never answer but I never quite forget."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's the sort of thing that I'd have asked but never expected of you."</p>
<p>"No; you never could have had it. That's the sort of thing that one gives but once." Suddenly she shot out her white, strong hand and gripped his wrist. "If you'd ever been really in love with me," she said fiercely, "you wouldn't let me die. You'd find some way to save me."</p>
<p>His rugged face softened with pain. "My dear," he said, "don't you know that if there were any way in the world, any sacrifice——"</p>
<p>"Yes; I know; I know! I'm sorry. That was a rotten thing to say."</p>
<p>"You've taken it all like such a good sport."</p>
<p>"I'm trying. Let's not talk of it any more. Let's talk of the girls. Bob, how much is there to heredity?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord! Ask me to square the circle. Or make the fifth hole in one. Or something easy."</p>
<p>"I was just thinking. Who's going to look after them? Ralph won't be of much use. He's too detached."</p>
<p>"Well, the family physician can be of service in some ways," he said slowly. "Particularly if he chances to be a family friend, too."</p>
<p>"Would you?" she cried eagerly. "They'll be a <a id="Page_17" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 17]"></a>handful. Any modern girl is. But I'd rest easier, knowing you were on the job. Speaking of resting, I had rather a rotten night last night."</p>
<p>"What were you doing in the evening?"</p>
<p>"We had a little poker party here in the room."</p>
<p>He shrugged his heavy shoulders. "If you won't pay any heed to your doctor's orders——"</p>
<p>"You know I won't."</p>
<p>"Then you've got to pay the piper."</p>
<p>"Haven't you got anything that will make me sleep?"</p>
<p>"Were the pains bad?"</p>
<p>"Pretty stiff. Will they get worse?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so, my dear."</p>
<p>"More dope, then, please."</p>
<p>"Dangerous."</p>
<p>"Well?" She smiled up into his face, pleadingly, temptingly. "Well, Bob?" Her voice dropped. "What's the difference? Since it's a hopeless case. Don't be an inquisitor and sentence me to torture in the name of your god, Science," she whispered.</p>
<p>He yielded. "All right. But you'll stand it as long as you can?"</p>
<p>"Good old Bob!" she murmured. She reached for his hand, twined her fingers around it, nestled it into her firm and rounded neck. Then she laughed.</p>
<p>"Well?" he queried.</p>
<p>"Association of ideas," she answered. "I was thinking of Cary Scott."</p>
<p>He winced and drew his hand away. "What of Cary Scott?"</p>
<p>"If he doesn't come back pretty soon, what a joke it will be on him!"</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00006">CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The Fentriss house stood high on a knoll overlooking the Country Club which constituted Dorrisdale's chief attraction as a suburb. Mona Fentriss had built it with a legacy of $25,000 left to her just before Patricia's birth, and Ralph had put in the $15,000 necessary to complete the work after the architect's original estimate had been exhausted, leaving the place still unfinished by one wing, all the decorations, and most of the plumbing. The extra cost was due largely to the constantly altering schemes of Mona. She wished her house "just so," and just so she finally had it from the little conservatory off the side hallway to the comfortable servants' suite on the third floor. If the result was, architecturally, a plate of hash, as Ralph called it, nevertheless the house was particularly easy to live in.</p>
<p>To Mona Fentriss belonged the credit for this. What she had of conscience was enlisted in her domestic economy. As Ralph Fentriss's wife she might be casually unfaithful. As mistress of his household she was impeccable. The effortless seductiveness of her personality established its special atmosphere throughout the place. It made the servants her devoted and unwearying aids, and broadly speaking, a household is much what the servants make it. People gravitate naturally to a well-run place. Life seems so suave and easy there. Guests of all ages came and went at Holiday Knoll, mostly men. Mona cared little for women, and her own strong magnetism for men had been inherited by her two grown daughters.<a id="Page_19" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 19]"></a> There was no special selectiveness about the company. All that was required of them was that they should be superficially presentable and contribute something of amusement or entertainment to the composite life of the ménage. At least nine-tenths of them were making love to Constance or Mary Delia or Mona herself, openly or surreptitiously as the case might be.</p>
<p>It made a pleasantly restless and stimulating atmosphere. In the city itself there would have been criticism of the easy standards; indeed there was more or less which drifted out to the Knoll. But judgments in the suburbs are kindlier. And Dorrisdale is quite fashionable enough to establish its own standards.</p>
<p>Any week-end would find half a dozen or more cars bunched on the driveway, having brought their quota of pleasure-seeking youth out from New York or from Philadelphia or Baltimore or Princeton. The girls had carte blanche, within reasonable limits, for invitations, which they were careful not to abuse. A few errors in judgment had reacted unpleasantly not only upon themselves but upon their undesirable guests. Mona Fentriss could act with decision and dignity within her own walls. Her social discrimination was keen if not rigid, and she possessed a blighting gift of sarcasm, mainly imitative, the most deadly kind used against the young. Neither of the girls was likely ever to forget her imitation of Connie's friend from Minneapolis whose method of handling a fork, according to Mrs. Fentriss's theory, had been derived from bayonet practice in camp; nor her presentation of a steamship acquaintance of Dee's who had too pathetically bewailed his losses at bridge.</p>
<p>Partly from theory, partly as a trouble-saving device, the mother seldom attempted any exercise of direct authority upon the children. A system of <a id="Page_20" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 20]"></a>self-government was established, or, rather, encouraged to grow into being. It was ordained that each of the girls should have her own room to hold like a castle, into which not even the parents might intrude unbidden, and for which the occupant was held responsible. Constance's room was luxurious, lazy, filled with photographs mainly of groups in which her charming face was always central. The special mark of Mary Delia's was its white and airy kemptness. Patricia's was a mess of clothing and odds and ends, tossed hither and thither and left to lie as they fell until a temporary access of orderliness inspired the child to clean up. It suggested a room in which no window was opened at night. Fentriss called it the hurrah's nest.</p>
<p>Through this feminine environment he moved like a tolerant but semi-detached presiding genius. His profession as consulting engineer took him early to the city and that, or something else, often kept him late. Being a considerate though rather selfish person, he invariably telephoned when detained over dinner time, which made the less difference in that there were always two or three men dropping in after golf, hopeful of an invitation to stay: Harry Mercer or the Grant twins, or Sam Gracie, or one of the Selfridges, father or son. Envious mothers whispered that Mrs. Fentriss was trying to catch Emslie Selfridge for Constance, and that it might not be as good a match as she supposed; things weren't going any too well at the Selfridge factory since the strike. They also wondered acidly that Ralph Fentriss was so easy as to let his pretty wife go about so much with Steve Selfridge, who was almost old enough to be her father, it was true, but whose reputation was that of a decidedly unwithered age. It would no more have occurred to Fentriss to raise objections over Mona's going where she pleased, with<a id="Page_21" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 21]"></a> whom she pleased than it would have occurred to her to ask his permission. All that was past long ago.</p>
<p>The outside member of the family was Robert Osterhout. He lived near by in a small studio-bungalow where he conducted delicate and obscure experiments in the therapy of the ductless glands. Thrice a week he lectured at the University, for he had already won a reputation in his own specialty. Having inherited a sufficient fortune, he was letting his private practice dwindle to a point where presently the Fentriss family would be about all there was left of it. Into and out of the house on the knoll he wandered, casual, unobtrusive, never in the way, always welcome, contributing a quiet, solid background to the kaleidoscopic pattern of its existence. In the most innocent of senses he was <i>l'ami du maison</i>. If he was and had for years been in love with Mona, the fact never made a ripple in the affectionate friendliness of their relations nor in the outward placidity of his life. It was accepted as part of the natural scheme of things. Fentriss recognized it, quite without resentment. Mona wondered at times whether Constance and Mary Delia were not aware of it—not that it would have made any difference. She herself made little account of it, yet she would sorely have missed the stable, enduring, inexpressive devotion had it lapsed. Bob was the intellectual outlet for her restless, fervent, exigent nature, too complex to be satisfied with physical and emotional gratifications alone. One could talk to Bob; God knows, there were few enough others in her set with any understanding beyond the current chatter of the day! After her sentence was pronounced she talked to him even more frankly than theretofore.</p>
<p>"If Ralph had died, Bob, I'd probably have married you."</p>
<p><a id="Page_22" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 22]"></a></p>
<p>"Would you?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that? That you wouldn't have married me?"</p>
<p>"I'd probably have done as you wished. I always do."</p>
<p>"So you do, old dear! That's the reason I'd have married you. That, and to keep you in the family, where you belong."</p>
<p>"I'll keep myself in the family, Mona, if you want me there."</p>
<p>"But Ralph didn't die," she pursued. "I'm going to, instead. You can't marry Ralph."</p>
<p>"Not very well."</p>
<p>"But you might marry the girls."</p>
<p>"All of 'em?"</p>
<p>"Connie, I think. She's most like me."</p>
<p>"She isn't nearly as pretty as you."</p>
<p>Mona blew him a kiss. "She's much, much prettier. Don't be so prejudiced. And she's very intelligent, for twenty-two."</p>
<p>"About half my age."</p>
<p>"Oh, she'd catch up fast enough. She's quite mature."</p>
<p>"Much too attractive for an old husband, thank you. That way trouble lies—as you know!"</p>
<p>"Thanks, yourself!" She thrust out her tongue at him in an impudent, childish grimace. "Perhaps you'd prefer Mary Delia."</p>
<p>"I understand Dee better than I do Connie."</p>
<p>"Do you? It's more than I do. She's devilish frank about other people but she never gives herself away."</p>
<p>"That's what I like about her."</p>
<p>"You really are quite chummy with her, aren't you?" said the mother, looking at him curiously. "But that's because you're so much older. She doesn't care much about men really."</p>
<p><a id="Page_23" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 23]"></a></p>
<p>"She's unawakened. There's hot blood under that cool skin."</p>
<p>"I wonder what makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a medically trained man notices little things."</p>
<p>"So does a woman. But I haven't seen—— Has Dee begun to awake?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! She's quite unaware of herself in that way. Very likely she won't until after she's married."</p>
<p>"After? Won't that be a little late?"</p>
<p>"It's the first awakening a lot of women have. And a harsh one for some."</p>
<p>"What a lot of unpleasant things doctors know about life!"</p>
<p>"Life's got its unpleasant phases."</p>
<p>"Particularly for women.... Yet I'm glad I've been a woman." A little, sensuous quiver passed over her tenderly modelled lips. She smiled, sighed, and reverted to her other thought. "But you're going to have your hands full with the Fentrisses. Really, you'd do better if you married one."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I shouldn't do as well. I might be too taken up with the one."</p>
<p>She darted a glance at him, full of shrewd questioning with a touch of suspicion. "You <i>could</i> care for Dee," she interpreted. "I'd be more flattered if it were Connie." She pressed an electric button. To the trim maid who appeared she said, "Send Miss Dee here, please, Mollie."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do, Mona?" demanded Osterhout in some alarm, for he knew the devastating frankness with which she was wont to deal with those nearest her.</p>
<p>"Wait and see."</p>
<p>There was a rhythmic, swift footfall on the stairs, the<a id="Page_24" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 24]"></a> door was thrown open, and Mary Delia Fentriss swung in upon them.</p>
<p>"Hello, mother!" she said. "Hail, Lord Roberts! What's the summons?"</p>
<p>Her bearing attested poise, careless self-confidence, and a brusque and ready good humour. She was tall, rounded, supple, browned, redolent of physical expression. At first sight one knew that here was a girl whose body would exhale freshness, whose lips would be cool, whose breath would be sweet, whose voice would be even, whose senses and nerves would be controlled. A student of humankind might have appreciated in her the unafraid honesty and directness which so often go with the consciousness of physical strength, in women as well as men. Her nickname in the family was Candida. She was not beautiful; not even pretty, by strict standards. But there was about her a sort of careless splendour.</p>
<p>"Been playing golf?" asked her mother.</p>
<p>"Yes. Cantered in with a forty-seven."</p>
<p>"Nice going! How would you like to marry Bob?"</p>
<p>Neither the expression nor the attitude of the girl altered, but her cool and thoughtful eyes turned upon Osterhout. "Has his lordship been making proposals for me?"</p>
<p>"No; I haven't!" barked the gentleman in the case.</p>
<p>"Watson, the strait-jacket! He's growing violent."</p>
<p>"It was wholly my idea," proffered Mona.</p>
<p>"I thought Bobs was your special property. Why mark him down? It isn't bargain day."</p>
<p>"He's a fairly good bargain, though," pointed out her mother.</p>
<p>"Don't mind me if you want to discuss my good points," said Osterhout, lighting a cigarette and seating himself upon the window sill.</p>
<p><a id="Page_25" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 25]"></a></p>
<p>"I don't," said Mary Delia. "Let's consider him as a market proposition. His age is against him. You're forty, aren't you, Bobs?... He doesn't squirm, mother. That's a bad sign; shows he's reached the age where he doesn't care. Or is it a good sign, showing his self-control?"</p>
<p>"Dee, I'd beat you if I married you."</p>
<p>Her eyes lightened. "Would you? I believe you'd try." With a bound she was upon him. One arm crooked under his shoulder, the heel of the other fist was thrust under his chin. "Improved jit," she panted. "You'd have your work cut out."</p>
<p>There was a quick shift, a blending of the two figures, and the slighter was bent backward almost to the floor. "Give up?" demanded Osterhout, his face close above the laughing lips.</p>
<p>"Yes. Lord, you're quick! Thought I had you. Take your penalty and let me up."</p>
<p>Ignoring the invitation he set her in a chair and restored his deranged necktie. "I'll apologise for the forty," said Dee. "You're not so old and feeble! To resume, as we say when serious; you're homely as a scalded pup——"</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>"—but it's a nice homely. You've got a lamb of a disposition. <i>And</i> money enough. Haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Enough for me."</p>
<p>"How passionately he pleads his cause! You play a nasty round of golf, too; I mustn't forget that. But—no. I don't think I would. Not even if you asked me."</p>
<p>"What's the obstacle, Dee?"</p>
<p>"Well, for one thing, there's Jimmy James."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Quite so," said the girl sedately.</p>
<p><a id="Page_26" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 26]"></a></p>
<p>"You're engaged to James?"</p>
<p>"We haven't got that far yet. But I've got him on the run."</p>
<p>"Dee!" expostulated her mother, laughing.</p>
<p>"Does he know of your honourable intentions?" queried Osterhout.</p>
<p>"He hasn't expressed his own yet. But he will."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Next time I kiss him."</p>
<p>"Next time, eh? How many times will that make?"</p>
<p>"Haven't counted, Grandpa," mocked the girl. "We haven't pulled many petting parties, though."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm good-and-be-damned," muttered Osterhout.</p>
<p>"Modern stuff, Bob," remarked Mona.</p>
<p>"Being an ancient fossil, I'd say dangerous stuff with a fellow like Jameson James."</p>
<p>"Not with a girl like me," returned Dee with superb assurance. "Bee-lieve muh, I've got a hand on the emergency brake every minute."</p>
<p>Osterhout, who had returned to his window seat, gave a sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>
<p>He rubbed his cheek, growling. A hoarse, childish voice from below, which had in it some echo of Mona Fentriss's lyric and alluring tones, served to answer the question:</p>
<p>"Where did I hit you, old Bobs?"</p>
<p>"It's the Scrub," said Dee.</p>
<p>"Don't you call me 'Bobs,' you young devil."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>all</i> right! <i>Doctor</i> Bobs. Come down. I've got a fer-rightful gash in my knee."</p>
<p>"Well, don't show it to the world. I'll be there immediately."</p>
<p>"If you want to be the family benefactor," said Mary<a id="Page_27" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 27]"></a> Delia as he was leaving, "marry Pat. Nobody else ever will."</p>
<p>"You're a liar!" came the hoarse voice from outside. There was a pause as for consideration. "A stinkin' liar," it concluded with conviction.</p>
<p>"Pat!" called her mother.</p>
<p>"Oh, very well! But I bet I'm married before I'm Dee's age. And to a better man than Jimmy James. He's a chaser."</p>
<p>"We've got to send that child away to school," said Mona Fentriss in amused dismay as the door closed behind Osterhout. "She's growing up any old way, and she seems to know everything that's going on.... Dee, are you really going to marry Jimmy James?"</p>
<p>"I think so. Any objections?"</p>
<p>"Well, Ada Clare, you know."</p>
<p>"He's through with her."</p>
<p>"She's the kind that men don't get through with so readily. It's gone pretty far."</p>
<p>"It's gone the limit probably. Well, I never thought Jimmy was President of the Purity League, Mother."</p>
<p>"Do you really care for him, Dee?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. I don't mean that he gives me an awful thrill. Nobody does."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the right man would."</p>
<p>"Then I haven't seen him yet. Mother," she turned her cool regard upon Mona, "tell me about it."</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"The thrill. The real thrill. You know."</p>
<p>Mona's colour deepened. "You're a queer child, Dee. There are some things a woman has to find out for herself."</p>
<p>"Or get some man to teach her," supplied the girl<a id="Page_28" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 28]"></a> thoughtfully. "The whole thing's mostly bluff, <i>I</i> think. Men are queer things. I could laugh my head off at Jimmy sometimes."</p>
<p>"That's a good safeguard."</p>
<p>"Yes; but I don't need it.... Mother, aren't we going to pull a big party this spring?"</p>
<p>"Of course. And we ought to do it pretty soon, too."</p>
<p>"What makes you say that so queerly?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," answered Mona hastily. "I was just thinking."</p>
<p>For though she was up and about again, she knew that she was weakening under the heart attacks which she endured with silent fortitude, due partly to natural pride, partly to her belief that a complaining woman lost all charm for those about her, winning only the poor substitute of pity instead of admiration. Upon Dr. Osterhout she had imposed silence; she was determined that her household should know nothing so long as concealment was possible. In her way she was an unselfish woman.</p>
<p>She was quite aware that this would be the last of her parties in the house on the knoll.</p>
<p>Pat's voice floated upward in tones of lamentation. "Oh, damn it, Bobs! Go easy, can't you? That stuff's like fire."</p>
<p>"Patricia's fifteen," reflected the mother. "I'll enter her at the Sisterhood School next fall."</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="Page_29" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 29]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00007">CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>The party was a Bingo. Before midnight that had been settled to the satisfaction of everyone. The music, good at the outset, soon become irresistible. (A drink all around every seven numbers was the Fentriss prescription for the musicians; expensive but worth it.) The punch was very special. Several of its masculine devotees had already faded, and one girl had been quietly spirited to an upper room, there to be disrobed and de-spirited. There was much drifting in and out of the French windows to the darkness of the lawn, and plaintive inquiries for missing partners were prevalent. Lovely, flushed, youthful, regnant in her own special queendom, Mona Fentriss sat in the midst of a circle of the older men, bandying stories with them in voices which were discreetly lowered when any of the youngsters drew near. It was the top of the time.</p>
<p>Upstairs in her remote bed Patricia sat with her pillows banked behind her, her knees propping her chin, her angry eyes staring into the dark. The strong rhythms of the music, barbaric, excitant, harshly sensuous, throbbed upward, stirring her to dim and uninterpretable hungers.</p>
<p>"Damn! Damn! Damn!" she whispered in shivering wrath.</p>
<p>She had been banished from even the earliest part of the festivities. It was mean. It was rotten. It was stinkin' rotten. Why should she be treated so? She wasn't a baby. She wouldn't stand it!</p>
<p><a id="Page_30" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 30]"></a></p>
<p>Leaping from bed she ran to her tumbled clothes, began feverishly to put them on. In undergarments and stockings she crept across to Dee's room, listened and entered. This was gross violation of the law of the household. But Pat was desperate. Selecting a pink dinner dress rather high-cut for Dee, she held it against her half-developed body, decided that it would do, ran back with her booty to her own den. Putting it on before the glass she became unpleasantly conscious of several pimples on her face. She was always having pimples! The others never had them. She wondered why, resentfully. Should she pick the one at the side of her nose? Or would that only make it the more unsightly? She decided for the heroic method, performed a clumsy operation with a pin, and perceived at once that she must have some powder. This time it was Connie's room that she invaded, and while she was about it she found and added a touch of colour. It was by no means the height of artistry, but Pat approved it as eminently satisfactory. She did not wholly approve Dee's dress. There was too much of it in important spots. She meditated padding, but did not know how it was done. Or—dared she go back and get a scantier frock? Contemplating her boyish contours she realised that it would not do.</p>
<p>"Flat like a board," she muttered disparagingly. "I'm bunched all in the wrong places."</p>
<p>That the gown which fitted Dee's slender strength to perfection should oppress Pat across her round little stomach, struck her as an unjust infliction of fate, instead of the proper penalty of gluttony, which it was. The maltreated pimple—another sign and symbol of her unrestrained appetite—still bled a little and was obviously angry. She staunched it impatiently. The others, she decided, would do as they were. Not unskillfully she<a id="Page_31" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 31]"></a> touched the area around them with little dabs of Mme. Lablanche's Rose-skin.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have one dance," she decided, "if they send me to jail."</p>
<p>The back stairs and a side window gave her unobserved exit to the odorous shelter of a syringa.</p>
<p>"I'll wait until I can catch Bobs," she ruminated. "He'll dance with me—old bear! But first I'll do a little scouting."</p>
<p>She peeked into the big living room where most of the dancing was in progress. As was invariably the rule at Holiday Knoll, men held the superiority of numbers, and therefore, girls that of position. Every girl had a partner. To the ungrown waif outside of fairyland the dancers seemed ethereal beings, moving in a radiant and unattainable world. How beautifully the girls were dressed! How attractive the men looked!</p>
<p>"I wish I was pretty," mourned Pat. She thought forlornly of her blotchy skin. "I never will be, though." Then she recalled the deep, eager lustre of her eyes as seen in the glass, and how one of the boys at school had once made awkward and admiring phrases about them. She had not liked that particular boy, but she was grateful for the phrases. Maybe if she paid more attention to herself she might come to be attractive like her lovely mother. No; that was too much to hope; never like her mother, nor like Constance, who was just then whirled by in the arms of one of the New York guests, all aglow with languorous triumph, easily the beauty of the party. Perhaps like Dee. Lots of men were crazy about Dee. Would any man ever be crazy about her, wondered Pat.... Wouldn't she look a smear if she did venture on the floor among all those human flowers? She left her window to prowl further.</p>
<p><a id="Page_32" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 32]"></a></p>
<p>The glass door of the breakfast room gave her a view of the proceedings within. Sprawled upon the tiles five of the youthful local element were intent upon the dice which one of them had just rolled toward a central heap of silver and bills.</p>
<p>"Seven! I lose again," said the thrower cheerily. "Who'll stand for hiking the limit to a dollar?"</p>
<p>Opposite Pat's vantage point sprawled Selden Thorpe, son of the local rector. Pat knew they had not much means and, marking the pale, strained face of the boy, wished with misgivings that he wouldn't. The misgivings vanished when she heard him say:</p>
<p>"I'm an easy hundred ahead so I can't kick. Let 'er go."</p>
<p>She stepped back into the darkness to round the conservatory wing and brushed the mudguard of a lightless limousine. A girl's voice strained, tremulous, and laughing lent caution to her retreating steps; but she stopped within listening distance.</p>
<p>"Don't, Freddie! I'll have to go in if you——"</p>
<p>"Oh, come, Ada! Be a sport."</p>
<p>"Do behave yourself. Get me another drink."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>As the man stepped out, Pat shrank behind the car. She had recognized the girl's voice as that of Ada Clare, who had the reputation of being an indiscriminate "necker." Pat passed on. But that whisper from within the limousine, with its defensive, nervous, eager, stimulated effect, troubled the eavesdropper with strange, disturbing surmises. She wanted, yet feared to return and wait until Fred Browning, a man of thirty, well-liked in the neighbourhood, not the less perhaps because of his reputation as a "goer," came back with the desired drink. What would be the next step in the unseen drama? A little stir of fear drove Pat onward. She stopped<a id="Page_33" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 33]"></a> abruptly at the end of the conservatory as she heard her mother's voice within.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sid, dear! I almost wish I hadn't told you."</p>
<p>Sid! That was Sidney Rathbone, a Baltimorean, much given to running over for week-ends. To Pat's mind he was stricken in years, being nearly forty, but the <i>most</i> distinguished looking (thus her mentally italicised characterisation) person she had ever seen and distantly adored. Furthermore there was a quietly knightly devotion in his attitude toward the beautiful Mrs. Fentriss which enlisted the submerged romanticism of the child's mind. Now she hardly recognised the usually smooth and gentle tones characteristic of him as he replied:</p>
<p>"My God, Mona! I can't believe it. I won't believe it."</p>
<p>"Poor boy! It's true, though."</p>
<p>"What does Osterhout know about it! He's no diagnostician. You must come to Baltimore and see Finney or Earle——"</p>
<p>"It's no use."</p>
<p>What Rathbone next said the listener could not make out, but Mona answered very gently:</p>
<p>"No, Sid, dear. Not again. That's all over. I couldn't now. You understand." And then the man's broken voice:</p>
<p>"Yes; I understand, dearest. But——"</p>
<p>"Oh, Sid! Please don't cry. I can't bear it."</p>
<p>Pat blundered on into the darkness, rather appalled. What in the name of bewilderment did <i>that</i> mean? Mr. Rathbone crying! And her mother's voice was so sad. Though she did not care much for her mother beyond a lively admiration of her charm and beauty, Pat experienced a distinct chill. It was followed by a surge of exultation; she was certainly seeing life to-night! And then came the climax. A blithe voice at her elbow said:</p>
<p><a id="Page_34" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 34]"></a></p>
<p>"Hello! Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Sh—sh-sh-sh!" she warned in startled sibilance.</p>
<p>"Shush goes if you say so. Not dancing?"</p>
<p>"No. They wouldn't let me," said Pat mournfully.</p>
<p>"Who wouldn't?"</p>
<p>"The family."</p>
<p>"Snoutrage," declared the stranger economically. "You're one of the family, are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm the kid. I hate it."</p>
<p>"Cinderella; yes? The lovely but wicked sisters—they're peaches, too." He spoke clearly but a little disjointedly. "But you're not rigged for the part. You've got your regal rags on."</p>
<p>"They're not mine. They're my sister's. I sneaked 'em."</p>
<p>"Snappy child!" he laughed. "Let's have a look."</p>
<p>He moved closer to her. A wale of light fell across his face. He was short and fair with a winsome, laughing mouth, and candid eyes. Drooping her chin Pat studied him covertly and decided that he was a winner. She herself was in the shadow; he could see little but contour. But the rich hoarseness of the voice pleased him.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I found you," he murmured.</p>
<p>Thrilling to his tone, all that she could find to say was:</p>
<p>"Don't speak so loud."</p>
<p>Naturally he took this as an invitation, and, moving still closer, felt for her hand in the darkness. Her fingers twined willingly within his. Instead of alarming her, his touch gave her confidence.</p>
<p>"What are you doing out here?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Cooling off. The family brew's got quite a kick in it."</p>
<p>"Has it? Get me some."</p>
<p>"You're too young."</p>
<p>"Don't be hateful."</p>
<p><a id="Page_35" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 35]"></a></p>
<p>"What'll you give me for it?" he teased.</p>
<p>It was the first spur that her instinct of conscious seductiveness had ever known. She replied instantly:</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"You're on. Wait for me right there."</p>
<p>While he was gone, a long time as it seemed to her, she stood surging with an exultant inner turmoil. A man and a girl passed close to her, unseeing in the bar of light. The girl's eyes wore a strange, sleepy expression as if the lids were almost too heavy to hold open. The man's shoulder was pressed close upon her. They disappeared. Strange scents of the night crept into Pat's brain; made her remember things she had never known. The music, softened through intervening walls, was pleading sensuously, urging upon her something mysterious and desirable. She felt her nerves like strung wires already tingling with electric forces but awaiting the supreme shock.</p>
<p>"Drink, pretty creature!" The gay, insinuating, mirthful voice was close to her.</p>
<p>"You've only half filled it," she complained, taking the glass.</p>
<p>"Must have spilled some. In such a hurry to get back to you," he explained. "There's plenty more where it came from if you like it."</p>
<p>"I don't," she gasped. The liquid, of which she had taken a generous swallow, stung in her throat. She poured the rest out upon the ground. "Here," she said holding out the glass to him.</p>
<p>His fingers met hers again. The glass fell and crunched beneath his foot as he stepped to her. She was hardly cognisant of his arm drawing her. Rather what she felt was some irresistible power compelling her to itself. The face of the youth, still gay with laughter, drew down<a id="Page_36" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 36]"></a> upon hers, closer, closer, changed, seemed to become dimly luminous. Her arms, without volition, crept upward to his shoulders. She was incongruously and painfully conscious of something pressing into her bosom, one of his pearl shirt-studs, and drew away from it slightly. He bent his head after her. And then, as their lips met and merged—the shock!</p>
<p>She went limp under it.</p>
<p>After a long, long minute in which were blended the pulsations of the music, the undermining odours of the night, the look of the passing girl's eyes (how heavy were her own now!), the memory of that broken whisper overheard in the limousine, and the surge of the blood in her veins, she heard him say:</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"I've got my car here."</p>
<p>She was silent, deeply, passively acquiescent to his will. Misconstruing her speechlessness, he urged:</p>
<p>"Come on, sweetie! We'll take a fifty-mile-an-hour dip into the landscape. The little boat can go some."</p>
<p>"I'll have to get a wrap."</p>
<p>"Take my coat."</p>
<p>His arm tightened, guiding her. She lifted a hungry face. He bent again when a door opened shedding a broad ray of light upon them. Against the glaring background moved Constance, a vision of witchery in her filmy gown, followed by Emslie Selfridge.</p>
<p>"Pat!" she exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>Before the confused girl could reply, her escort came briskly to her rescue. "I caught it peeking behind a bush," he explained, "and it wasn't a bur-gu-lar after all. So I'm taking it in to see what it is and whether it can dance."</p>
<p><a id="Page_37" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 37]"></a></p>
<p>"It's my kid sister," said Constance. "Mother <i>will</i> be pleased!"</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell her?" demanded Pat.</p>
<p>"I certainly am."</p>
<p>"Then I may as well have my dance before you find her," declared the culprit calmly.</p>
<p>"The fourteenth, a foxy little trot; with Mr. Warren Graves," put in her escort cheerily. He drew her arm through his own where it nestled gratefully.</p>
<p>Armoured though he was in the careless self-confidence of youth, young Mr. Graves winced as his partner stood revealed under the full glare of the lights. She looked so awfully and awkwardly young! Her hair was so awry, her gown so ill-fitted, her skin so splotchy. But there was magic in the long, slanted, shy, trustful eyes looking into his own, and the tingling excitation of her kiss was still in his blood. Moreover he had had a steady succession of drinks.</p>
<p>"How old are you?" he asked in her ear as her cheek pressed close to his.</p>
<p>"Seventeen," she lied glibly.</p>
<p>"Sub-deb stuff," he laughed. "I love 'em young. You can dance, too. Can I have the next?"</p>
<p>"There won't be any next," said Pat tragically. "Here's Mother."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord!" said Warren Graves. "Let me do the talking."</p>
<p>But no talking was called for. Mona Fentriss swept down upon her truant daughter, caught her in a laughing embrace, slapped one hot cheek, kissed the other, and delivered her verdict!</p>
<p>"Back to bed with you! Quick! How did you ever get out?"</p>
<p>"Can't I have just one more turn," pleaded Pat.</p>
<p><a id="Page_38" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 38]"></a></p>
<p>"Not a step. Where did this roost-robber"—she indicated Graves—"find you?"</p>
<p>"I was looking on and wanting in," replied the dismal and thwarted Pat.</p>
<p>"Wait three years, until you're seventeen. Away!"</p>
<p>"Let me escort you to your—er—baby-carriage," said the youth with an elaborate bow.</p>
<p>The feeble witticism, meant only to cover his own sense of being at a loss, stabbed Pat. She averted her angry and tearful eyes as they crossed the floor together.</p>
<p>"I hate you," she muttered.</p>
<p>"I'm crazy about you," he retorted close to her ear.</p>
<p>Instantly she was radiant again. "Good-night," she said softly and ran up the stairs.</p>
<p>The turn of the landing hid her from view. But, after a moment's struggle with herself against doubt, she stopped and leaned out over the rail. There he stood with the blithe expectancy of his face upturned. Queer looking, unkempt, ill-dressed she might be, and hardly more than a child at that, but the glamour of her youth and her passion held him.</p>
<p>"Don't forget me," he pleaded under his breath.</p>
<p>She nodded. Forget him! With the fervent assurance of the neophyte she was sure that she never would, never could forget him and the moment which he had deified for her. And herein her inexperience was a true mentor. For, whatever else may pass from her crowded memories, a girl does not forget her first kiss.</p>
<p>Pat had been mulcted of that dance which she had rebelliously promised herself. But there was compensation in overflowing measure.</p>
<p>She had had her taste of life.</p>
