<body><p class="indent">Rather pathetic as information, isn't it? But not half so pathetic as the fact that writers and editors really <i>know</i> so little as to the reading public's preference on this point that even such weak-kneed conclusions as the above are of some small value because they are at least drawn from a few data of fact. Nor one-tenth so pathetic as the fact that, while this commonly accepted theory seems justified by the above straw, there are quite a few other theories commonly accepted by writers, editors and critics that lack the support of even so slender a fact-straw as this.</p>
<p class="indent">As stated at the beginning of the chapter, the real value of the investigation is the answers' proof that the question of first person versus third is wholly a matter to be decided according to each writer's individuality and the nature of each particular story he takes up. Not by anybody's general rule.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page408" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 408]"></a></p>
<p class="h2">QUESTION XII</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="indent"><i>Do you lose ideas because your imagination travels faster than your means of recording? Which affords least check—pencil, typewriter or stenographer?</i></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="indent">This question, like the preceding one, was added to the questionnaire at the suggestion of several experienced writers with whom I consulted. As is pointed out in some of the answers, the choice of means of recording would seem a matter to be decided wholly in accordance with the idiosyncrasies of each particular writer. But human nature is somewhat prone to settle down upon one method without trying all and it may well be that some writers now wedded to one method may, on learning the experiences of over a hundred others, try some new method and find it advantageous. Certainly the answers as a whole give an interesting and full presentation of the practical arguments for and against the various methods, and, as in all the answers to the questionnaire, there are various bits of information not always bearing directly on the particular issue that will be found illuminating and valuable.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Answers</span></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bill Adams</b>: Never lose an idea while I'm writing. (Be nothing left if I did, m'lad.) God help poor sailors.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Samuel Hopkins Adams</b>: Yes; but I catch a lot in the act of escaping by keeping a reserve sheet of paper close at hand while writing, and I will break off in the middle of a sentence if necessary to pin the fugitive down. Pen or pencil. You can't head off an escaping idea with a typewriter. I've never tried a stenographer for fiction; if I did, she would lead a wild-goose chase sort of existence, for my mind constantly courses ahead of my plot and <a id="page409" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 409]"></a> brings in small game to be attended to while the main chase proceeds.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Paul L. Anderson</b>: No, because I have the whole thing planned beforehand. Sometimes, if I have an unusual idea, which seems likely to get away, I note down a word or two on a scrap of paper and keep it by me while writing. This happens oftener with a turn of words than with a fundamental idea. The fastest mode of production, by far, is dictating to a s'nog'f'r, as they are usually called in conversation. Next, the typewriter; next, the pen; last, the pencil—the blame thing keeps getting dull and you have to stop to sharpen it! I can seldom afford a stenographer, but when I can, and have a good one, composition is unalloyed bliss; I can light a cigarette, put my feet up, and live the whole story, without distractions. Joy!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Ashley Anderson</b>: With a typewriter of light touch I can write most clearly and sharply, because, I think, I feel the restraint of the appearance of words actually in type.</p>
<p class="indent">The most agreeable tool to me is a goose quill. I only used quills a little while, in England, where they are still in use even in government offices. There is practically no friction between the quill and paper, and no noise. The effect is complete privacy and smoothly flowing words. I do sometimes lose ideas which get away from me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. C. Bailey</b>: I never lost ideas by forgetting them. I write in pencil and slowly. Dictation or typewriting would be impossible to me for any imaginative work.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Edwin Balmer</b>: Typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ralph Henry Barbour</b>: I don't think my imagination ever gets so far ahead of my means of recording that I lose ideas. As to those means I prefer a typewriter. I have never tried to dictate—to a stenographer. I don't believe that I'd like it. Or maybe the stenographer wouldn't. Anyway, I intend to keep on pounding it out myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick Orin Bartlett</b>: I use a typewriter and find <a id="page410" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 410]"></a> that travels fast enough for me—as long as I don't worry particularly over what keys I hit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nalbro Bartley</b>: No—I do all my stuff on a typewriter. I revise it personally—I make the final copy myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Konrad Bercovici</b>: I never lose any ideas. I never begin to put them down until they are rounded out in my mind. One never loses anything except what he does not care to possess.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ferdinand Berthoud</b>: Yes, I do, but I mostly pick them up again unexpectedly, perhaps months afterward. Always write my draft in pencil, as it is easier to make instant alterations. Also the clicking and mechanism of a typewriter are liable to bring me suddenly back from out of my dream world.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. H. Birney, Jr.</b>: No; I don't think so. Story is pretty well outlined in my mind before I start writing. I personally write entirely with a fountain pen. Dislike the "scratching" of a pencil and the lack of permanency of penciled notes. Have tried doing my work direct from brain to typewriter, but find that the purely mechanical strain of using ten fingers, returning carriage, watching right-hand margins, etc., tends to hamper thought. Tried stenographer only once, so am not qualified to express opinion there.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Farnham Bishop</b>: I always compose mentally before I begin to write. Conceived the plot of <i>Malena</i> while walking post, outlined the whole novel and held it in my head until I came off guard. Often come back from a walk with one or two long paragraphs composed and memorized, ready to be set down. I have held ideas and worked them over mentally for months and years, before writing a word on the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">That being the case, I almost never write except on my trusty Corona, H. &amp; P. Method.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Algernon Blackwood</b>: Imagination invariably travels faster than power of recording it. I use shorthand to jot <a id="page411" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 411]"></a> down bits that flash ahead of the words I am actually typing at the moment. These flashes otherwise prove irrecoverable. With a stenographer beside me I could not think of a single sentence. I compose straight on to my own machine.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Max Bonter</b>: Typewriter seems to afford me least check in recording thoughts. I write Pitmanic shorthand two hundred words a minute, but seldom use it in composition. In this case my hand is speedier than the flow of ideas. Moreover, ideas that would flow as fast as that would not seem to be reliable. Such a flow of bull would have to be edited very carefully afterward—so why be so precipitate? Better take it easier and pay more attention to logic than verbosity.</p>
<p class="indent">The clatter of a typewriter does not disturb my train of thought. I don't need a sound-proof cell when I write. When I feel in the mood for writing my spine is stiff and I sit straight in my chair and punch hard. I like to feel the keys bounce back from the platen. It makes me feel as if I'm punching something and getting somewhere.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Katharine Holland Brown</b>: Yes. Either the typewriter or a pen. Never a stenographer.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>F. R. Buckley</b>: Never lost an idea that way yet. I write extremely fast, and without conscious effort, on the typewriter—up to ninety words a minute. I used to write in pencil and pen when on English newspapers; now I'm used to the typewriter, I find it and the hand-methods' check equal. I mean, typewriter used to check me, now hand-writing does. Just what you're used to. Typewriter for me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Prosper Buranelli</b>: It seems to me that a writer is a person with the gift of gab, but whose gift of gab is slower than the jawbone. Slow typewriting is about the speed of my gabble.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thompson Burtis</b>: Yes. I have never used any other means of writing than a typewriter. I do not believe that I would be effective through a stenographer, and I'm <a id="page412" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 412]"></a> damn certain that I'd never write a line unless I was starving if I had to depend on pen or pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George M. A. Cain</b>: I do lose ideas before I can catch up to them with the recording. I have never done any writing for publication otherwise than directly upon the typewriter. Any handwriting entirely confuses me. I can use a typewriter blindfolded. I can write with it twice or three times as fast as with the pen or pencil. Without having tried it, I imagine that the presence of a stenographer would greatly bother me at first. I have always thought that I might possibly get better results by using a dictaphone and then cutting out about two-thirds of what I said to it. Heaven knows I am prolix enough on a typewriter. I hesitate to credit heaven with any generally distributed knowledge of what I would do, if it involved no greater effort than talking.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert V. Carr</b>: When manufacturing literary sausage I naturally want to grind it out rapidly. But if I am working on what seems to be a good story, I can get my ideas down with a pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George L. Catton</b>: Lots of ideas are lost that way, though they generally come back. Pencil, with me, affords the least check on loss.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert W. Chambers</b>: Do not lose ideas thus. Pencil and eraser.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Roy P. Churchill</b>: I believe the mind can be trained to construct with the means at hand. I have seldom lost any real valuable ideas by having the spirit run away with the physical construction of some sort of record. At first I wrote with pencil, which is slow, then on a machine, which is faster, and now dictate to a rapid stenographer. I have had to get the habit of each method, and time would be lost if I had to change again.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Carl Clausen</b>: Sometimes. Pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Courtney Ryley Cooper</b>: That depends also. I use every possible style of writing. I have started a story by pen, switched to pencil, gone to the typewriter and <a id="page413" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 413]"></a> dictated the climax, the reason being this: I must write character slowly. I must do action as swiftly as it is possible for me to put it down. And when the action becomes too fast for my typewriter, I dictate. In other words, although it is bromidic, I know, I live my stories to a great extent. I personally go just as slow or as fast as the story itself—there are times when I can not write swiftly to save my life—because I am in a maze of slow characterization. Then again, I have to go like an express train to keep up with my story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur Crabb</b>: To some extent, but not seriously. I sometimes have trouble in retaining ideas that come when I am off the job. Pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Mary Stewart Cutting</b>: No, as I said before, when I imagine anything, I write it down and so do not lose my ideas. A fountain pen in my hand greatly facilitates thought and expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elmer Davis</b>: Yes, but still worse because I sit around and think about the damn thing before I start writing at all, and most of the good stuff is gone by the time I drag out the old mill and get to work. Never tried anything but typewriter, though I have seen stenographers who would take a man's mind off the fleeting thought and the evanescent phrase.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Harper Dean</b>: No, I can keep up with my ideas, because I can write fast on a typewriter. I seldom leave it until the story is done in its first draft—an eight-thousand-word story will go down in the rough before I leave the machine. Then come the long careful hours of revision and rewriting, the thumbing of my Thesaurus. But I must get it down in black and white while I am hot with it—that's why I'll never write a book. I couldn't write a thousand words to-day and a thousand to-morrow. No, when I'm full of the thing it must be written.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Harris Dickson</b>: No. I am an expert typewriter and stenographer, and have so few ideas that I can not afford to let one get away.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page414" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 414]"></a> <b>Captain Dingle</b>: I can only write one way—typewriter—straight out from my imagination. Neither pen nor pencil helps, nor any amount of notes, except such as are necessary to avoid errors of date or place. Imagination seems to keep up. When it slows, I know it's time to clew-up for a spell.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Louis Dodge</b>: If I get a good idea—conceding that I ever do—it never gets away from me permanently. It'll come back. But I get along better with a typewriter. It's easier, that's all.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Phyllis Duganne</b>: I don't lose ideas because my imagination travels faster than my means of recording while I'm actually working. I can lose them through being interrupted before I've finished. A typewriter affords least check; it's almost impossible for me to write with a pencil. And my own typewriter is so well trained that it can write just about as fast as I can put my thoughts into words.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>J. Allan Dunn</b>: I find that my own typing keeps up fairly well with my imagination, a little behind, far enough to look over the situation ahead and amend or alter it. But then I have usually thought out my day's typing beforehand, probably several times over. The machine is less check than any other medium, but it was not until I had acquired a certain speed. If my technique bothers me I can sometimes dictate very rapidly. I find, however, that the matter of proper punctuation, dialect and unusual spelling suffers at the hand of another—this includes a dictaphone. I had a hard fight getting away from pencil to the typewriter, but I don't want to go back.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter A. Dyer</b>: I write pretty rapidly, and so I seldom lose ideas. When I find my mind running ahead it is usually a warning that what I am doing is dull. If an idea jumps into my mind that I am afraid I shall forget, I sometimes stop and jot down a note of it. Usually the best stuff comes when the mind and the typewriter are well synchronized. I used to write with a lead pencil, but <a id="page415" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 415]"></a> I have learned to use a typewriter with less effort and so with better results.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter Prichard Eaton</b>: I lose ideas because I quit to play golf. When I am writing I should certainly feel sore if I couldn't hold one till I got it down. I never use a typewriter—never found one that could spell. When I use a pen I write so badly that nobody can tell whether it can spell or not. I can't dictate. I at once begin to write like Daniel Webster's Bunker Hill Oration.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. O. Foster</b>: I lose ideas because my imagination travels faster than my typewriter. Of the four channels—pen, pencil, typewriter and stenographer, the typewriter affords the least check to my imagination.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur O. Friel</b>: Yes. Pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>J. U. Giesy</b>: At times. The typewriter serves me best.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George Gilbert</b>: I use the typewriter, because I am skilled on it to the point where I can write two thousand four hundred words an hour. I once wrote ten thousand words at one sitting, averaging two thousand an hour. The story was not revised materially. I gained this skill transcribing one hundred million words during my long career as an Associated Press code operator, taking twelve thousand to fifteen thousand words a night for many years. I can think on the machine easily.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kenneth Gilbert</b>: While I do not lose ideas because of mechanical inability to set them down rapidly, I lose enthusiasm for them, and, perhaps, some of the precious fire that would make them glow stronger. I find a typewriter the least check on my imagination. I have never tried a stenographer, but I have long felt that a dictating machine would be very helpful.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Holworthy Hall</b>: Not yet. Pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Richard Matthews Hallet</b>: My imagination does not travel at better than a snail's pace. I could do a cuneiform inscription without the sacrifice of a single idea. Sometimes I compose on a typewriter and sometimes with <a id="page416" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 416]"></a> a pen. If you write fast on the typewriter, if you really do bring the speed dogs into play, and you are a fast thinker, you gain momentum, I should think. But I always gain momentum at the expense of nearly everything else. I do at most two thousand words a day, even on re-write stuff, and going at this pace, you can see that my imagination does not feel the lag of the writing instruments. A friend of mine leans into the horn of a dictaphone every morning and sprays vocal folly there; but I never got courage for that. That horn would follow me in dreams.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William H. Hamby</b>: Yes. To me the pen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>A. Judson Hanna</b>: I certainly would lose ideas because my imagination travels faster than my means of recording had I not adopted a plan for nailing down these fugitive ideas. When an advance idea comes to me I break off composition instantly, even in the middle of a sentence, and record the advance idea. Later I run back over the rough draft, pick out the fugitive ideas and insert them where they are most effective. I began by writing with a pen, slowly; discarding the pen for the typewriter, and finally settling down to the use of the pencil on any scrap of paper that is at hand when the thoughts come, writing so swiftly that I have trouble in deciphering my writing if I allow it to become "cold." As my mind works now, I could not use a stenographer. In fact, the mere presence of another person in the room where I am writing disconcerts me and disorganizes my train of thought.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Joseph Mills Hanson</b>: My imagination seldom travels faster than my means of recording. I find it easiest to do original writing with a pencil. The next easiest method is with a typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. E. Harriman</b>: At times my ideas seem to run down a smooth chute at lightning speed and no stenographer or human tongue could keep up with them. I lose some on the way. The machine for me every time.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nevil G. Henshaw</b>: I often lose ideas by not being <a id="page417" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 417]"></a> quick enough to get them down. For first draft I can't go beyond a pen or pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Joseph Hergesheimer</b>: Pen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert Hichens</b>: No. I write always with a pen and not very fast.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>R. de S. Horn</b>: Yes; that is one of the most provoking things about writing. The imagination so far outspeeds all methods of recording that I can command.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clyde B. Hough</b>: I am able to express ideas as fast as I can compose them. Dictation to a stenographer is the easiest method in writing for me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Emerson Hough</b>: I never have any ideas to lose. Sometimes I write in longhand, sometimes on the typewriter. I dictated about half of <i>The Mississippi Bubble</i> direct on the machine in my business office. Wrote the rest at home between ten o'clock at night and four in the morning. If you <i>think</i> the medium does not matter, does it?</p>
<p class="indent">I don't really see much use in trying to get at these things. Every fellow writes in his own way, or ought to do so. So far as these things helping other writers may be concerned, I really don't think there is much in it. It's a hard enough game, and so far as I can get at it, experience is the only teacher in it that is worth a cuss. Sometimes not even experience is worth that much. Advice is nearly always worth a great deal less.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>A. S. M. Hutchinson</b>: Not, I think, when I am actually writing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Inez Haynes Irwin</b>: My husband, Will Irwin, believes that difficulty in the mechanical means of expression makes for lucidity and elegance of style. He always uses pen or pencil. I think this is only partly true. I think there are times when it is impossible to get things down with enough speed. I am sure that sometimes I lose ideas and expressions when imagination is flowing free and I can not register its outpouring quickly enough. I can of course get my ideas expressed more quickly when I dictate <a id="page418" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 418]"></a> to a stenographer. There is no doubt in my mind that a story gains <i>directness</i>, a certain fluency, fluidity and plasticity—and a quality, which comes from the spoken word alone—in dictation. Perhaps equally it loses in precision and compression. I started writing with a pencil; rejected the pencil for the typewriter; the typewriter for dictation to a stenographer. Now I am writing with the pencil again. Next month, I may revert to the typewriter. In my opinion an ideal way to compose would be to dictate the story first and then rewrite the dictated version with a pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Will Irwin</b>: I can not remember ever losing an idea because my means of recording was not fast enough. In writing fiction, and generally in writing journalism, I use a pen or lead pencil. I have a tendency to be diffuse, and a slow and difficult means checks this. I regard the typewriter and dictaphone as the enemies of style.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick J. Jackson</b>: My imagination travels fast, but I get a death clutch on my ideas. Typewriter is my favorite: cleaner, more effective copy. Pen next. Pencil too mussy. Stenographers are the bunk. Haven't found one who can take my stuff right.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Mary Johnston</b>: There are ideas too swift for our catching—as yet. I prefer a soft, black pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>John Joseph</b>: Yes, my pencil lies beside the machine and I make a great many notes, otherwise I'd lose many good (?) ideas. The typewriter affords the least check to the imagination.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lloyd Kohler</b>: Yes, I have often lost ideas because my imagination travels faster than my means of recording. A pencil or fountain pen affords the least check. I have never tried the stenographer plan—I'm afraid I'd be a little self-conscious; gun-shy, you know.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Harold Lamb</b>: No, when the imagination travels over a bit of ground it is always able to return. As for ideas, a penciled note, a word or so, will bring them back A typewriter gives least check, probably due to habit.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page419" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 419]"></a> <i>Tamen shud!</i></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Sinclair Lewis</b>: Rarely. Typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hapsburg Liebe</b>: My imagination often travels too fast, and then I make notes. I use a pencil for writing names of characters and the situation roughly; the rest I do on a typewriter; <i>it makes a better, clearer picture for me to see as I go along</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Romaine H. Lowdermilk</b>: I do lose ideas that way. I can get them down better with pencil, for it gives opportunity for quick substitution and marking-out. Still, I do most of the work on a typewriter, as it is more convenient when it comes to revision (double space). I can't always read what I write by hand. My imagination works best at night; criticism in the morning. I do best thinking in hot weather. I don't get up at night to write but have lost good ideas by not doing so. And I hope there's something useful in the foregoing!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Eugene P. Lyle, Jr.</b>: Not often—not often enough. Ideas are slow travelers. I wish they could keep up with my fingers on the typewriter. Typewriter affords the least check, or about the same as a pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rose Macaulay</b>: Yes. Waterman's safety fountain pen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Crittenden Marriott</b>: Pen and stenographer about the same.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Homer I. McEldowney</b>: I have a skeleton of my entire story. It is simply scribbled in a hurry and I keep the pen moving fast enough to prevent the ideas from getting away before I can rope and hog-tie them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ray McGillivray</b>: Stenographer. Often she interjects ideas into the scripts I never even imagined. Still, she's not bad, though a letter like this would burn out her bearings.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Helen Topping Miller</b>: My stories are usually fairly complete in my mind before I begin to write them. Usually the first thousand words are so completely formulated that I could recite them before I put a line on paper. <a id="page420" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 420]"></a> No matter what I am doing—traveling, teaching, going about my domestic tasks, I am "making up" stories "in my head," as the children say. I write on a typewriter, usually, though I am able to work as rapidly with a fountain pen on rough paper. I can not use a pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thomas Samson Miller</b>: I use pen, and sometimes an idea slips in memory, but nothing of great importance, and if it is best work—work done over and over—the idea is picked up again.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Anne Shannon Monroe</b>: Yes, I am never able to keep up with my ideas; often I have to stop typing and make a note on a scrap of paper, of something on ahead, fearful lest I forget it when I come up with it. I use a typewriter altogether.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>L. M. Montgomery</b>: I don't think many ideas ever get away from me by reason of slowness of recording. My aforesaid note-book habit has been of tremendous value here. I write with a pen and couldn't write with anything else—at least, as far as prose is concerned. When I write verse I always write on an ordinary school slate, because of the facilities for easy erasure. But for prose I want a Waverly pen—this is not an advertisement—I just can't write with any other! a smooth unlined paper and a portfolio I can hold on my knee. Then I can sail straight ahead and keep up with any ideas that present themselves. But these are only personal idiosyncrasies and have nothing to do with a writer's success or non-success. So no aspiring beginner need despair because his or her stationer is not stocked up with Waverly pens!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick Moore</b>: I sometimes lose ideas because my imagination travels too fast. It may be that those ideas are like the fish that got away—not so big. But just the right angle on a situation will sometimes slip away and won't come back for days. Then it is not wise to chase it too hard, for it seems to get out of reach entirely if pressed too close. It frequently comes back under the queerest circumstances and when least expected. The writer works <a id="page421" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 421]"></a> all the time—at the theater, walking, and sometimes when talking with another person on other subjects. My own hands on the typewriter beat everything in the way of creating. I have tried all others. The other person, in dictating, seems to act as a barrier with me. I find myself watching the effect of what I dictate on that person, or the secretary makes faces or looks bored, or makes a noise when he breathes, or looks at me. So I have to do it myself to avoid assault and battery. And I won't allow machine copying, for I find that if I copy myself, I change the turn of a sentence or add to something that makes an improvement. And a stretch of writing is more exhausting than a similar period at the hardest of labor. Only the writer knows what a sapping, wearing job writing a story happens to be. That is what makes 'em so cranky.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Talbot Mundy</b>: The typewriter seems best, but I am going to try a dictaphone by way of experiment. As regards the losing of ideas, "when found make a note of" is probably the remedy. Then the only difficulty is to force yourself to consult your note-book and, having consulted it, to link up again the hurriedly made note with the wonderful winged idea that inspired it.</p>
<p class="indent">The only stuff really worth writing is poetry, although I'd hate to have to read nothing else! The stuff I enjoy reading most of all is philosophy and metaphysics. Next after which, good books of travel and treatises on finance and bee-keeping hold the board.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that the apex of exquisite enjoyment is, for instance, reading Kant or John Wesley and shooting their arguments all to pieces. But I can't afford to enjoy myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kathleen Norris</b>: To "lose ideas" seems to me to imply an untidy sort of brain. The imagination needed for a story should not be a spasmodic, incoherent, impulsive sort of business, but an orderly production. A person who would lose ideas would also lose her purse, her friends, her petticoat, and eventually, I should suppose, her mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page422" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 422]"></a> <b>Anne O'Hagan</b>: I think I'll answer this the other way around, naming the things that oppose the <i>most</i> check in their order—pen, stenographer, typewriter, pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Grant Overton</b>: I always compose on the typewriter. I should lose ideas if I had to write by hand, but I generally sit down to a day's work of possibly three concentrated hours with only a vague idea of what I shall write about. I may know a sentence or two. I let it build itself up from moment to moment. All the ideas and most of the pictures grow out of the moment before.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Sir Gilbert Parker</b>: I could not dictate a word, and I never used a typewriter. All I do is written by hand with a pen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hugh Pendexter</b>: Often. But they usually come back to me without any conscious effort to reclaim them. The typewriter is my best medium for setting down the story. I never use pen, pencil, or dictate. But there is no medium ever invented that can keep up with a man's imagination and preserve all the coloring and minutiæ of effects.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clay Perry</b>: I used to lose ideas because of being unable to get them on paper fast enough, but since I educated my two forefingers to the hunt and touch system on the typewriter that happens very seldom. Having done practically all my fiction work for the past five years on a "mill" and never through dictation, I can not say whether dictation would help more. A pen or pencil would "cramp my style" very badly, now. I've synchronized my mind to the "mill." However, I believe this is purely an artificial, mechanical condition which could be worked out, one way or another, in necessity.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Michael J. Phillips</b>: Newspaper training has disciplined my mind so I lose nothing through failure of speed to transcribe. It is all right for some, but I would be afraid of a yarn that forced me to such speed. The thing would be impossible when I had finished it. Usually use typewriter and copy all of my own short manuscripts, having longer ones copied by stenographer. The newspaper <a id="page423" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 423]"></a> game has taught me to dictate either over the phone or to stenographer; to typewrite; and to write with pencil with equal freedom. I wouldn't care for a pen. Under the circumstances, the typewriter is the most practicable, so I use it almost exclusively.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter B. Pitkin</b>: I lose much through inability to record fast enough. I work best when typing myself; next best with a pen or pencil. I am totally unable to dictate anything but the deadest form-letter stuff to even the most sympathetic stenog! I have two utterly distinct styles and manners, one when writing freely and one when talking to a secretary or stenog. The latter is simply awful.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. S. Pladwell</b>: No. My imagination travels fast but I do not lose ideas because of it. Out of a hundred ideas, five are good. Those five, if good, need not be forgotten. It works out automatically. I remember a good idea. The rest can go hang.</p>
<p class="indent">Being a newspaper man, I use the typewriter constantly and now I can not write longhand without a cramp in two minutes.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucia Mead Priest</b>: Sometimes my thoughts get ahead of me. If they are not nailed down they are likely never to come again.</p>
<p class="indent">I can keep up fairly well—if I do not have to <i>decipher</i> the <i>next day</i>, I am safe.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not use the typewriter for several reasons. Mechanical things are irksome; I am lazy.</p>
<p class="indent">I use a pencil and a stenographer does the rest.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Eugene Manlove Rhodes</b>: Yes. Pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frank C. Robertson</b>: I find it pays to turn the imagination loose until the story is well outlined in the mind before touching paper. Then it is comparatively easy to concentrate upon the immediate problem before you when you sit down to write. I compose only on the typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ruth Sawyer</b>: Yes. I prefer typewriter. And when the material is definitely clear and fresh in my mind I prefer dictating.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page424" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 424]"></a> <b>Chester L. Saxby</b>: Pen or pencil is a greater drag on me than a typewriter is. Due to habit, no doubt. I have never dictated. Oh, yes, ideas crowd on at times; but with a pencil I should find the crowding rushed my writing into chicken-tracks I couldn't read afterward. The very fact that typewriting holds me back I regard as an advantage; the first impulse must too frequently be rejected. Literature should be cooked up in hot blood—and then written <i>cold</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barry Scobee</b>: I would lose ideas because my imagination travels faster than my typewriter, but I jot down points for my story, even pages ahead, as I go along and they come to mind. Typewriter affords least check for me. Never tried a story with any other tool.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>R. T. M. Scott</b>: I lose a few ideas because my imagination travels faster than my means of recording but I usually pick up others, equally good, which I would have missed had my recording kept pace with my thoughts. The typewriter affords me the least check, but I believe that to be a matter of habit. One thing about a typewriter is that you get a better look at your stuff as it goes down.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert Simpson</b>: I don't lose many ideas owing to a rapid fire imagination. I haven't got one. Frequently it goes wandering off into bypaths, but the only thing I lose then is time. Everything I write is first written and revised in pen and ink. I detest a typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur D. Howden Smith</b>: No. Typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Theodore Seixas Solomons</b>: I seldom lose ideas in that way. From my answer to II you will see that even if I happen to think faster than I can write, if the thought is a useful one it automatically attaches itself to my memory. As to the mechanism of writing, I am only now abandoning the pen and using, for almost all composition, the typewriter. But for the greater legibility and the quickness, when quickness is needed, of the machine, I should continue with the pen, for with me it is most conducive to <a id="page425" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 425]"></a> careful first expression. I write with widely separated lines—about twice the usual spacing, or even three times. This, either with the pen or on the machine. My purpose is to avoid the necessity of making a new draft on new paper when I come to revise. I now use but the one manuscript draft, making all my changes on that. Occasionally I am obliged to prepare some new sheets, but ninety-five per cent. or more of the original sheets are retained. If I happen to be in my stride, or, what is more likely, if the matter happens to be easy to write, a page or two may escape with little correction. Again, I may line and interline, but I have the space and by using a fine script, which comes easy to me, I am able to make great changes and additions while retaining the original page.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of this will be manifest when one considers the value of having before one constantly, in his revisings, all his past thought and expression. Here, in my way of working, I have before me always the complete history of the fashioning of the thought—the sentence or paragraph. Often I later resume the original form, having found, by the lapse of time, that the improvement I sought and fancied I had achieved involved some objection greater than that I strove to remedy. This and many other advantages of this method would be impossible if a completely new copy were made, for one would never think to go back to the old, and if he did it would be difficult and cumbersome. Incidentally, it is a time-saver. When my first draft is a typed one I revise with the pen on the same sheets.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Raymond S. Spears</b>: I can keep up with my typewriter, when writing stories. If my mind jumps ahead too fast, I make a pencil note to recall the look into the future of the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Norman Springer</b>: The mind always runs ahead of the work. It plays around the sides of the story, so to speak. But I don't think there is any loss. If an idea isn't used, it sinks back into the mind and some day it pops up again.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page426" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 426]"></a> I compose on a typewriter. It is a plodding business. But fast enough, for I find myself pausing only too often.</p>
<p class="indent">This query brings up another item. It is the difference between <i>thinking</i> a story and writing it. And I find that this too is a common experience among writers I know.</p>
<p class="indent">Thinking up the story is fine work, pleasant and exhilarating. When you have your materials and your characters you think out the yarn from beginning to end. Everything seems crystal clear, every detail in its proper place, every difficulty solved. It appears to you to be a very good story indeed and ridiculously easy to write.</p>
<p class="indent">You begin to write, and alas, the story that seemed so clear in your mind turns out to have been not clear at all, but nebulous. As you thought it, it was beautiful; as you write it, it is a mess. No matter how hard you try, you can never get down upon paper the wonderful story you <i>thought</i>. The best you achieve is a caricature.</p>
<p class="indent">Another common experience is what I call "bumping into the stone wall." There comes a time in every story, usually toward its end, when you get stumped. By this time, anyway, you are usually pretty well disgusted with the tale. It is so inferior to what you planned, so different from the fine story you saw when you thought it out. Your mind is also eager to be at new work. So you bump into the stone wall.</p>
<p class="indent">This wall is usually some little hitherto unconsidered detail that suddenly assumes huge proportions. It seems to have wrecked your story. There is nothing to do then but plug, and pretty soon the difficulty is surmounted.</p>
<p class="indent">I mention this because I've noticed that the "stone wall" is the place where the new writer is apt to throw up the sponge.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Julian Street</b>: I have that tendency but have trained myself to catch the ideas as they come by. The fancies that come when one is writing I have often called "butterflies of thought." One must be ready always with the net and <i>get</i> them before they fly out of the window again.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page427" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 427]"></a> <b>T. S. Stribling</b>: I never lose my ideas if I catch any. Anything will do except a stenographer; I can't bear to have another person in the room while I work; they disturb me just as much sitting silent and motionless as if they were raising bedlam.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Booth Tarkington</b>: Sometimes. The pencil is best for me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>W. C. Tuttle</b>: I have never dictated any copy. I am not fast on a typewriter—using only two fingers and profanity—but I am never more than two chapters behind my imagination. Seriously, I never know what the next paragraph is going to contain.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucille Van Slyke</b>: I'd like to kid myself along by thinking I lose heaps of ideas that way, but common sense tells me they aren't very impressive or I wouldn't lose them. Typewriter. Except at those heavenly, rare—awfully rare—moments when I get a faint inkling (no pun intended!) of how it must feel to be an inspired writer instead of a bungling, struggling tortoise of a scribbler who is handicapped by being a trifle softheaded and by having to carry a beloved house around on her back as she crawls. At those times I like a big fat pencil, a whole box of big fat pencils.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Atreus von Schrader</b>: No. Typewriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>T. Von Ziekursch</b>: Find the typewriter most satisfactory. Occasionally have stopped to jot down a note on some touch that I know I wanted to add later in the story and might forget in the fever of the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Henry Kitchell Webster</b>: I don't think I ever lost an idea because my imagination had outrun the means of recording. I sometimes dictate, sometimes write on the typewriter; I think the difference is unimportant.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>G. A. Wells</b>: My imagination would move miles ahead of my writing instrument if I let it. I therefore adjust the tempo of my imagination to keep pace with the recording instrument. I think the use of a recording instrument depends upon the mood. I have trouble using a typewriter <a id="page428" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 428]"></a> in artificial light. Can not use a pen during the day with the same facility as at night. I detest a pencil and very seldom use one. My mind is more free with a pen than with a machine, though most of my writing is done altogether on the machine.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Wells</b>: No, because I can call them back. Typewriter; can't dictate, get all balled up; maybe lack of practise.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ben Ames Williams</b>: I use a typewriter and find it satisfactory; to use pen or pencil for more than a few minutes tires me, physically, and my handwriting becomes entirely illegible.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Honore Willsie</b>: Sometimes. Soft pencil.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. C. Witwer</b>: I have lost many ideas, plots, titles, bits of dialogue, etc., because my imagination has traveled faster than the means of recording it. It has not always been convenient to make notes. For example, I might be working on a story and later be at a theater or almost anywhere, and an idea for a funny or dramatic scene in this particular yarn will strike me. By the time I get back to my story, intervening events may have driven the idea entirely out of my mind. Yet weeks afterward it will crop up again most unexpectedly, apropos of nothing at all, and I'll think, "Darn it, I should have used that in such and such a story!"</p>
<p class="indent">I find the typewriter affords least check and work on it exclusively.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Almon Wolff</b>: I can keep up with my imagination when I use a typewriter; I can't with pen or pencil. I can't dictate at all. That is, I suppose, a matter of habit and custom.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Edgar Young</b>: Write directly on a typewriter by touch system and rewrite from another person's reading where I catch many inconsistencies and change them as I write. I consider composing on a typewriter a very poor method and wish I had always used a pencil, marking out swiftly when the wrong word or sentence was put down. <a id="page429" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 429]"></a> This letter is a fair sample of what I compose at a first draft.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></p>
<p class="indent">Total answering, 111. Losing ideas through too slow means of recording, 43; 10 of these prevent a final loss by making notes. Not losing, 55.</p>
<p class="indent">In tabulating the means of recording affording least check or preferred for general reasons, in several instances where a writer habitually still uses more than one, a score has been given for each. The heavy predominance of the typewriter was rather surprising to the tabulator, as was also the greater use of pencil than of pen. Typewriter 63; pencil 24; pen 23 (4 of these specified fountain pen and 1 a goose quill); longhand (neither pen nor pencil specified) 1; dictation to stenographer 9; any 1; any but stenographer 1. No dictaphone except 1 prospect.</p>
<p class="indent">This tabulation, like all others in this book, though carefully made, can not be exact, some answers not lending themselves to definite or even entirely satisfactory tabulation. This is of little moment, since in all cases the only purpose to be served is that of ascertaining general tendencies and drawing general comparisons.</p>
<p class="indent">THE END</p>
