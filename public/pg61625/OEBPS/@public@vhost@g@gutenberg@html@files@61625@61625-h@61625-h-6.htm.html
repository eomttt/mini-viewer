<body><p class="indent">Neutral, 12.</p>
<p class="indent">For full description, 6.</p>
<p class="indent">Only a questionnaire carried into minute detail and answered by large numbers could warrant, in a subject of so many factors, any nicety of conclusion and, also, it is not to be forgotten that the answerers are not mere readers but readers who are also writers. On the other hand, they are in these matters trained and sensitive observers. In any case we are fairly safe in concluding that there exists in readers a tendency to dislike too full description as found in the fiction of to-day. Probably a prime cause of the dislike, in the case of visualizers, the majority, is the violence done to the reader's own instantaneous imagery by the almost necessarily different imagery the author's full description forces upon him, while to non-visualizers the author's imagery is not a picture at all. This violence to the visualizer is akin to that often furnished by an artist's illustrations of fiction.</p>
<p class="indent">An extraneous element demands consideration here. Fiction, largely because of its imitative tradition, does not develop so fast as the world it lives in. There is warrant for holding the classics as models, but only those elements of them that are universal in their appeal, that are good for all time. The mistake lies in swallowing them whole, or in admitting to their ranks fiction keyed too markedly to its own time alone. In particular, fullness of description is characteristic of certain past times whose fiction is often cited as a model. But meanwhile the world itself has ceased to travel in stage-coaches or on horseback and has taken to railroads and motors. Certainly ours is not so leisurely an age. Telephone, telegraph, steam, electricity, gasoline have geared our generation to a far faster speed. We lack our forefathers' happy patience over long descriptions. Try your boy on the stories you liked at his age. And do not forget the tremendous influence of the <a id="page207" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 207]"></a> motion pictures for speed of narrative and quick description.</p>
<p class="indent">But, whatever the element of time, human beings remain human beings and when you paint a word-picture satisfying only your own desire of imagery you will not only surely fail to please all, but your imagery may be such that only a small minority find in it any satisfaction. You can not chart the world of readers as to the exact proportions of its imaginative responses to sense appeals, but your technique is either shaky or happily haphazard if you have no general idea of relative imagination responses and of your own responses in relation to those of the majority.</p>
<p class="indent">5. <i>Stock pictures.</i> None of the 86 answering confess to them as habitual, though 23 have them to some degree or in certain circumstances. If the author fails to stimulate to special images, 8 resort to them.</p>
<p class="indent">6. <i>Imagination when reading vs. when writing.</i> Of 85 answering, 19 note no difference, 2 don't know, 1 is untabulated, while 63 note a difference. In most cases, however, the difference is only that the imagination is more active, vivid, concentrated, etc., though there are some notable exceptions. From the answers to this experimental question I am unable to draw any conclusions that seem worth consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">7. <i>The above as "tools of your trade."</i> Out of 73, 31 answer yes, 4 somewhat, 33 no, 2 doubtful, 2 find the question too complicated, 1 uses no tools at all. Of the 34 answering yes in any degree, some have stated in answer to another question that they do not consider the reader at all when writing and only a few of these make an exception of the work preliminary to the actual writing or of revision. These must therefore obviously be counted out under one question or the other, probably here, leaving a considerably reduced number with a claim to conscious attention in their work to the imagination differences of readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page208" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 208]"></a> The questions on imagination were answered in whole or part by 113, this particular question by 73. General knowledge of human nature would seem to give fairly good ground for concluding that most of the 40 not answering as to tools would have answered "no" if at all. In any case there are only a small number of the 113 whom we are warranted in listing under "yes." Of these few there were still fewer whose answers on the imagination questions as a whole left me unconvinced that their "yes" was to the real question at issue, though in their work they may well consider the necessity of appealing to all five senses. Even the remaining few give no single scrap of definitely conclusive proof that their "yes" means a weighing on their part of imagination differences among readers, but proof that they do not is equally lacking, with one probable exception.</p>
<p class="indent">Allowing for failures to tabulate properly in all cases, it is shown that only a small minority of these writers allow for the varying imagination powers of their readers or for their own imagination equations in relation to those of the majority. Is it not mere common sense to say that an understanding of these differences and relations should be assimilated into an author's unconscious technique or, failing that, be applied consciously in revision? It is all very well to say an author should just be himself and think not at all of those to whom he expresses himself, but as an artist it should be part of his art to see to it that his "himself" is in communication with those to whom he is trying to communicate, whether through his "other self" as their representative or directly. It is not art to talk to a deaf man or to persist in showing pictures to a blind man. Nor would it seem unassailably intelligent to talk in French to people who understand only Italian. Of what good is imagery if it can not be seen? What point in trying to interest picture-lovers or sound-lovers by refusing to give them pictures or sounds?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page209" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 209]"></a> Mention may be made of a few of the many stray points of interest made here and there in the answers.</p>
<p class="indent">Heat and cold were not included in the question, but fortunately crop out in some of the answers.</p>
<p class="indent">It might be possible to divide authors into two classes—intellectual and sensory. The former, unless they sacrificed individuality, would have comparatively little need of sensory appeal, their natural audience being beyond its reach. The latter class, however, would have acute need of every device for developing and furthering sensory appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Frequently the dependence of imagery upon actual personal experience is emphasized in the answers. Since imagination is incapable of constructing anything whatever except from elements familiar through experience, there is opportunity for a preachment on the value of getting as much personal experience of one's material as possible before attempting to mold it into fiction.</p>
<p class="indent">I can not resist pointing out that at least one writer who demands much description in what he reads gives almost none in what he writes.</p>
<p class="indent">One writer gives us a definite method for developing sight imagination. If others can also obtain results from it, the value of the suggestion is tremendous, and it opens the way into a comparatively unexplored field of immense possibilities. There is involved a study of the relation between keenness of sensory imagination and keenness of the corresponding senses themselves. Also the variation of both actual and imagination senses in correspondence to variation in physical or general nervous condition. Also, note that one answerer has observed a marked weakening of sight imagination after the age of forty, an age at which eyesight is likely to weaken markedly, while another says the ability to visualize through the imagination has been almost lost since adolescence.</p>
<p class="indent">At least two writers, one of them a friend, and I myself <a id="page210" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 210]"></a> have laid aside glasses after years of use by following the directions of an oculist whose method of cure for most eye troubles is based largely upon direct practise with visual imagination. By developing and strengthening that, improvement is brought about in physical eyesight. It is the reverse of the method used by Mr. Scott for developing visual imagination and serves to illustrate the intimate connection between the senses and imagination.</p>
<p class="indent">The connection between visual imagination and actual eyesight is comparatively unexplored territory, as is the similar connection in the four other senses. To what degree is a writer's power of imagery, of sense stimulation in general, dependent on his own powers of imagination? To what extent is his imagination sense-power related to his physical sense-power? Can the one be developed through the other?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page211" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 211]"></a></p>
<p class="h2">QUESTION IV</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="indent"><i>When you write do you center your mind on the story itself or do you constantly have your readers in mind? In revising?</i></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Thinking of the reader" is a phrase subject to many interpretations and there is no doubt that the answers to the question containing it are not based upon a common understanding of its exact meaning. To have given it, in the questionnaire, any definite one of its several interpretations would have limited the answers in scope and robbed them of much of the valuable suggestiveness and information they contain. And by this more comprehensive approach we shall come to a clearer understanding of that vague thing called "technique."</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the interpretation most commonly made was: "Have you cheapened your work by allowing a consideration of popularity to set aside what you knew your art demanded?" If we take the more usual phrase, "Do you write down to your readers?" or, "Do you write for money or for art?" the reaction, in perhaps most cases, to this interpretation of the question would be, "No, I do not consider the reader when writing," and many of the negative answers given are undoubtedly the expressions of this natural reaction, given without further analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand some writers do write for money, primarily for money, and quite honestly say so.</p>
<p class="indent">With a discretion born of experience I promptly avoid any opinion on the broad subject of whether what they write is therefore a calamity to Art, and retire hurriedly on the fact that said writers do do it. As a class, their reply to Question IV is more likely to be a Yes than a No.</p>
<p class="indent">But remember that so far as we are here concerned with <a id="page212" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 212]"></a> them, both those writers who do and who do not write primarily for money, all write for publication involving at least the expectation of money. That is no reason for a cry of hypocrisy against those who claim not to write for money; there is an entirely justifiable line between writing primarily for money and writing one's best and then getting what one can for that best. In the case, also, of those who admit writing primarily for money, a similar distinction can be drawn; in the long run there is no surer way of making money than by doing one's best and plenty of writers recognize this fact. There are also those, dependent on their pens for daily living, who make a deliberate but temporary business of quantity and popularity as the only possible way to reach a position where they can write without regard for these factors. Some of our acknowledged best reached their goal by this path and would answer our question Yes or No according to the time of its asking.</p>
<p class="indent">There are those, too, who write primarily for fame, or for mere popularity, and to whom money may be an entirely negligible consideration. These, writing for a consideration other than art itself, may be, for all purposes of this book, classified along with those who write for money. And there are those who write for no consideration except self-expression or the "joy of the working," acknowledging no object except art alone.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact remains that all of our answerers alike are having their work published, whatever motives may be involved. Before they put a word on paper they know the story is meant for publication. They know it from the first inkling of the idea that is to give it birth. They know that it will fail of publication unless in creating it they make it such that readers (editors) will be not only reached by its expression but favorably reached and that publication chances for later stories will be endangered or impaired if in the present one their expression fails to reach favorably the general reading public. Some of them are dependent <a id="page213" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 213]"></a> on publication success for their living; some are not; some are more interested in the creating than in its results; some are not. But all of them alike do publish. In saying that they never think of the reader, then, some of them must mean only that they do not think of him during the actual process of putting the story together on paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Otherwise they must maintain that when weighing the value of an idea or a bit of material for use in fiction they never consider whether that idea or material would be liked by the reading public or whether it might be of such nature that no magazine would publish it. If they do so maintain, either they should be able to support their claim, at least in part, by having for exhibit a very goodly number of unsalable stories that in their judgment are fully as good as the published ones, or else they must be recognized as individuals whose points of view, reactions and methods happen to be so identical with those of the reading public or of part of it that without thought, guidance or effort their stories invariably find public favor.</p>
<p class="indent">There are, beyond doubt, writers who write equally good but unpublishable stories, but I imagine most of them would tell us that said stories are unpublished solely because editors are lacking in discriminating judgment or have prostituted Art to Business, and that few of these writers would claim, however rigidly they had held to Art alone, that they had not written the great majority of these stories with the intention or hope of publication. There are, beyond doubt, also writers who at least approximate in themselves a fortunate reflection of the reading public's likes and dislikes. This identity of point of view and interest is either a happy accident involving no credit to them as craftsmen—it may be even a misfortune from the point of view of art, or else it has been attained unconsciously yet by a very definite pursuit of technique. This last point, however, is best left for discussion until after the answers to Question IV.</p>
<p class="indent">But if some of the answers were negative because the <a id="page214" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 214]"></a> answerers were considering only the time of actual drafting, not the preparatory work or even the revision, there are still distinctions that must be applied, still further obstacles to accepting negative answers as final, and these too must be left until the end of the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">If my question had carried with it all these analyses and distinctions there is, I think, little doubt that many who answered "no" would have answered "yes." As one writer puts it, "The distinction between thinking of a story and thinking of a reader is difficult. I suppose my mind is chiefly concerned with making the words express what is real in my imagination—but that implies considering a reader." There is extremely good reason to weigh these various distinctions before reading the answers given and before concluding—or believing these writers conclude—that the reader can or should be excluded from the artist's mind.</p>
<p class="indent">Are the answers, then, valueless? So far as the face value of the question is concerned, partly so. But the insight into various actual working methods is extremely valuable, and the answers to that undefined query, not in their mere yes or no but in their fullness and taken as a whole, open an unequaled path to an understanding of the nature, purpose and use of <i>technique</i>, a thing that even the dictionary defines haltingly and that among writers, editors and critics is only a term as vague as it is much used.</p>
<p class="indent">Before turning to the answers it must be noted that through a clerical error the words "In revising" appeared in only half the copies of the questionnaire that were sent out.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Answers</span></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bill Adams</b>: I never think of the reader—not even when the story is in print. If I do, I think it is a remarkably odd world to contain such queer ducks.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Samuel Hopkins Adams</b>: Damn the readers. I'm too busy with the immediate people of my imagination to worry about the dim and distant thousands.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page215" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 215]"></a> <b>Paul L. Anderson</b>: The story only, when writing; consideration of the reader comes in the preliminary planning.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Ashley Anderson</b>: I think only of the story without regard to readers, on the assumption that a good story will never fail to find readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. C. Bailey</b>: A distinction between thinking of the story itself and of the reader is to me difficult. I suppose my mind is chiefly concerned to make the words express what is real in my imagination—but that implies considering a reader. Of course it is necessary sometimes in revising to simplify.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Edwin Balmer</b>: On the story. When revising, somewhat on the readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ralph Henry Barbour</b>: In writing, my mind does its own centering, and it centers on the story. The reader gets a mighty small look-in. In revising, the reader is considered. But, as I've already said, I don't revise much.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick Orin Bartlett</b>: I never have my readers in mind either in writing or revising. It is extremely difficult for me to visualize a reader of any sort until the story is actually in print. Then I feel my audience only as individuals write to me or in some other way respond.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nalbro Bartley</b>: When I write, I think of only the story—never whether anybody is going to read it—or pay for it, for that matter. But when, after it has been cold-in-a-drawer for about a week, I revise, I try to think of the nature of the story which the editor originally ordered—whether or not it hits any forbidden spots and if the average reader is going to respond or not. I think impersonal revision is the most valuable sort.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Konrad Bercovici</b>: I never have the reader in mind when I write. I do not want him to have me in his mind either. It is the story. Nothing else.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ferdinand Berthoud</b>: I'm afraid that in my amateurish way I center my mind wholly on my story—laugh and cry with my characters. However, now I'm learning and <a id="page216" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 216]"></a> getting a little more experienced I am trying to be less selfish and to think of the readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. H. Birney, Jr.</b>: On the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Farnham Bishop</b>: Write for the story, revise for the reader. Except that, whenever explaining anything, I keep trying to be clear enough for the layman, accurate enough for the expert, and interesting enough for both. (Result of ten years lecturing on semi-technical subjects to general audiences.)</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Algernon Blackwood</b>: I never give the reader a single thought. To some imaginary reader, sitting at a desk inside my own mind, I tell my story. It is written to express—to relieve—an emotion in my own being. It is never written to please other readers or any imaginable public.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Max Bonter</b>: As closely as I have been able to come to it, I am a dual personality when I write. My imagination invents, but reason checks. Reason seems in my case to represent prospective readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Katharine Holland Brown</b>: First, write down all the story before it gets away. With no regard for any reader.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, revise, and try to make the story intelligible and to make it march.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>F. R. Buckley</b>: I center my mind on the story. I have thought of the readers beforehand, that is, I know what will go and what won't: have generally studied the magazine I'm writing for and got general atmosphere of the stuff it uses; can't get more than that. In this atmosphere I have framed the story as previously detailed. That's all I have to do with the readers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Prosper Buranelli</b>: I never think of readers—am never too sure I shall have any. You don't think of a third party, whom to convince, when you are working out a proof in geometry.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thompson Burtis</b>: I center myself on the story. Occasionally the readers enter the picture when I am using technical stuff which I realize I must write down to them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George M. A. Cain</b>: Am not clear about this. I endeavor <a id="page217" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 217]"></a> to tell the reader enough to guide him to so much of my vision as is vital to the story. I think he seldom escapes my consciousness. I think of him as reading what I tell. If I am writing for public speech, I think of myself as saying the words to an audience imagined before me while I write.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert V. Carr</b>: When I want to sell my story, I write with the reader in mind. When I want to enjoy writing, I forget the reader. I am not sufficiently egotistical to want to reform the reader, neither do I desire to uplift him or to change his prejudices and superstitions to fit my mold.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that intelligence decreases with numbers; therefore I am not a democrat. It has been my observation that nothing arouses the hatred of the average man so much as the power to do him good. If one has the power to hurt him, to destroy him, he will erect a statue in honor of the possessor of that power. But if one has the power to do him good, and he lacks that power, he will, sooner or later, fly at the possessor of the power to do good like a mad dog. Pessimistic? It is no more logical to hope for the best than to hope for the worst.</p>
<p class="indent">Why should I bounce a stone off the reader's head when all he asks from me is a shot of literary hop to make him forget the next installment on his tin canary, the ever-increasing double chins of his wife, his children who no longer make him feel a glow of pride by their resemblance to him, or his late patriotic debauch from which he is now recovering with a door-mat tongue and a general feeling of seediness? Why should I attempt to make a reader think, when I know so little myself? I should try to amuse him and let it go at that.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George L. Catton</b>: It all depends. Tastes differ. Personally I don't care a penny for "blood and thunder" stories, all action to no end and without a theme or soul. But the vast majority of readers to-day want that kind of story and if an author wants to keep eating he's got to <a id="page218" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 218]"></a> kill his own likes and dislikes for his stomach's sake. I like stories with action of brains, not brawn, but money talks. I have to keep my mind on my readers' likes and dislikes when I'm writing to keep my bread basket from blowing away. Otherwise I'd write what I liked myself, never think about my readers, and do better work—from a literary viewpoint.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert W. Chambers</b>: The story only. In revising, the story alone.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Roy P. Churchill</b>: My best stories come when I center on the story, but it is very hard when the readers' so-called limitations are so borne in upon you. For instance, terms and expressions of sailors seem to need some explanation when told to a landsman. Yet, do they? My most enjoyable reading is when the writer fires on regardless and lets you understand or not. Makes you work your own mind just a trifle to "get" what he is driving at.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Carl Clausen</b>: Always on the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Courtney Ryley Cooper</b>: Absolutely on the story. In revising, or rather editing, I watch the things that I know a reader will look for. But the story comes first. Because if it isn't a story—there won't be any readers!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur Crabb</b>: I think that when I write I have the story in mind and not the reader. The same is true in revising.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Mary Stewart Cutting</b>: I center my mind on the story itself. I have my reader in mind in so far as I wish to write it clearly; in the vernacular "to get it over."</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elmer Davis</b>: I used to center on the story itself, but they didn't sell. Now I center on the editor at whom I am aiming it. Yes, I know you will say that is all wrong. It is, for Tolstoy, Balzac, etc. But not for the sort of writers who make their living out of checks.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William H. Dean</b>: My God! Never on the reader! That's fatal. If one tries to write to or for an audience, his work is worse than mediocre. I think of my characters and their destinies, think only of them—do my best <a id="page219" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 219]"></a> to interpret, never to invent. If my readers like what I write, they agree with my interpretations. If any beginner should ask me to give him a single rule to observe, I should say, "Always write to interpret; you will go down in defeat if you ever deliberately set about to please any reader."</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Harris Dickson</b>: Don't think I ever have the reader in mind, except when in matters of local coloring I must consider viewpoints outside of the South and remember to make myself clear. Frequently I do not employ certain forms of colloquialism because the outside reader may not comprehend—and explanations are generally bad. In public speaking, however, this is different. There you face your audience and get a response. Many times the speaker practically follows his audience, falling into the same vein of thought and traveling along in harmony. Over and over again I felt this on the platform during our wartime publicity campaigns. Again, the speaker may feel a hostility or lack of comprehension in his audience, that he must go further, explain more clearly, hammer in a fact. Or he may feel that his audience has "got" his slightest gesture, that they comprehend fully, and no more is needed.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Captain Dingle</b>: I never think of the reader. I lose myself in the story. I am my characters, in turn, within limits.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Louis Dodge</b>: I think of my story, not of my readers, when I write; however, I try to finish my story—to put on paper what I have in mind, to make things fairly plain.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Phyllis Duganne</b>: I don't think of readers when I'm writing. At least, I suppose I do in a way—I try to make people and things in a story convincing, and as I'm convinced at the start, I must be considering readers. But I don't think of them consciously; it's just the story I'm consciously considering. In revising, I think frequently of editors—after all, they're rather important.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>J. Allan Dunn</b>: I do not think I have my readers <a id="page220" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 220]"></a> largely in the forefront of my mind, save as I know they are apt to clamor, through the editor, for the satisfactory ending. Which is one reason why I like to write for ——. There I am practically untrammeled. I am unconscious of an audience and I want to be.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter A. Dyer</b>: I become preoccupied, when writing, with the story rather than with my readers, and I am afraid I too often leave the editors entirely out of account. I have, however, in the case of stories for boys, had to keep my audience in mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter Prichard Eaton</b>: I never have my readers in mind when I write. My one job is to get into words the idea in my head. Alas! <i>before I begin</i> I consider whether it is an idea which will sell. That is because we all feel we have to live. In revising, I try only to make what I have written correspond more closely with the idea I set out to convey—and also, I try, often, to make my sentence rhythms more attractive to the ear.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. O. Foster</b>: When I write I center my mind on the story itself and I am ashamed to say that I do not have my readers in mind, except as I write I know there are over four million ex-service men in the United States who are probably watching to catch me in an inaccuracy. I also consider that I am writing about the time of the Spanish-American War and that the tactics and military evolution have changed considerably in these years. Fortunately I was also in the World War and know what the changes are.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur O. Friel</b>: The story excludes everything else.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>J. U. Giesy</b>: Mainly on the story, the scene and action I wish to paint.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George Gilbert</b>: I think only of the story. After it is written I think of selling it. But although this answer seems to exclude the readers, it puts them first, for I have confidence enough in what I write to make me think that if it is printed readers will like it. If I did not, I would not write anything.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page221" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 221]"></a> <b>Kenneth Gilbert</b>: When I write, my mind is centered on the story itself, but the reader is not forgotten, merely crowded back a bit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Holworthy Hall</b>: I never think of the reader at all. In the first place, I think of the story itself—and afterward if I ever consider any one else, it is the editor and not the reader. We are all constantly selling stories to editors, but never to subscribers. It is the editor's job and not mine—to consider what he imagines his subscribers want to read. During the actual writing of a story I think of nothing but the urgency of translating into words the ideas which are in my mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Richard Matthews Hallet</b>: When writing I certainly think first of pleasing myself in the effects I fight for; but a habit of stepping out of your own skin and into the skin of a reader should be a healthy one and indeed is three-parts, if not the whole of self-criticism, without a wholesome infusion of which I doubt if much real work gets done. But don't start by trying to please other people. Please yourself first. As Walter Pater says of "that principle axiomatic in literature," that, "to know when one's self is interested, is the first condition of interesting other people." I have gone astray before now by deluding myself into thinking I was interested in a given story simply because I had decided to write it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William H. Hamby</b>: On the story itself. I never think of the reader unless it is some point that it occurs to me might be misunderstood.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>A. Judson Hanna</b>: I seldom thought of the reader, merely writing a story as it came to me, until I began receiving the circulars sent to contributors by ——. When writing now I try to consider the effect of a story on the reader. I always have the editor in mind as I write.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Joseph Mills Hanson</b>: I think of the story; very seldom of the readers of it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. E. Harriman</b>: I center my mind on the story—try to make it natural—vivid—strong. The reader may go to <a id="page222" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 222]"></a> Hades for all I care then. All I am thinking of is the responsibility I have to bring this character out unblemished and with the affectionate regard of the public or to save that one alive and in possession of his claim.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nevil G. Henshaw</b>: In making the first draft I think only of the story. In revising of the reader.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Joseph Hergesheimer</b>: Never the reader!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert Hichens</b>: When I am writing, I do not think about readers, only about my subject, my characters and how I am expressing myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>R. de S. Horn</b>: When I write I consider the story alone, until it is almost finished or rather until the final corrections are ready to be made. Then I consider my readers only so much as to correct with an eye to avoiding technicalities which they might fail to understand. Every story in my opinion has one particular style prescribed by the story itself as visualized by the author. If he allows himself to be swayed by considerations of the people who will read it or the magazines that may buy it, he is playing himself false and I believe the story will show it. The thing to do is to write the story as your consciousness tells you it should be written and then leave it to the literary agent to find the magazine and class of readers that it will best fit. I think the best illustration of this fact is that invariably our best authors' biggest works have come before the magazines have had a chance to subsidize him and buy his output in advance, thereby purchasing the right to "advise" what form his work should take.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clyde B. Hough</b>: When I write I am not aware of the fact that there are to be readers. A standard is hung up somewhere in the back of my mind as a sort of goal to drive it, but my mind is really concentrated on the characters and their action, particularly their action.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Emerson Hough</b>: I never think of my readers. Poor people!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>A. S. M. Hutchinson</b>: Most emphatically no. I never give a thought to the reader. The idea of doing so is extraordinary <a id="page223" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 223]"></a> to me. It is impossible and ridiculous. How can you tell a story if you are thinking about its effect on the people?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Inez Haynes Irwin</b>: I do not think I ever think of my readers at all. In writing I am always thinking of my own impressions of my work. I have to bear in mind certain limitations of subject which publication in magazines involves. That of course is another story. Revising is a work I revel in—and I think only of my own pleasure.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Will Irwin</b>: In writing the story I have only the story in mind. In revising, I think of the reader. For by now I have the succession of events and pictures so clearly established in my imagination that I am likely to take too many things for granted.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Charles Tenney Jackson</b>: The story alone. I have never given the reader much thought. Now and then I wonder what the devil's the matter with an editor!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick J. Jackson</b>: In writing I center my mind on the story itself; the same fellow who takes the hindmost can take the readers. If my story can interest a critical reader like myself, it's a cinch it will interest others. I have a large number of partly completed stories. They were never finished because they did not interest <i>me</i>. If they have failed in this initial test they are too dead to have much chance with others.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Mary Johnston</b>: The story. In revising, the same.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>John Joseph</b>: I am quite sure that I never write a paragraph without pausing to consider the reader's probable reaction to it. Lately I have been learning to keep one eye on the editor too.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lloyd Kohler</b>: I think that as a rule I constantly keep my readers in mind while writing a story. At any rate, the stories which I have really wanted to write I have never written—because I know it would be dangerous to try to "get them over."</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Harold Lamb</b>: Think only of story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Sinclair Lewis</b>: Both, inextricably mixed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page224" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 224]"></a> <b>Hapsburg Liebe</b>: I don't have anything in mind but the story itself when writing a story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Romaine H. Lowdermilk</b>: I center on the <i>story</i> alone in the first draft. Thereafter I keep the reader in mind as I revise. Especially do I try to make each sentence and paragraph clear. I try to be merciful as well as lucid and say what I have to say as clearly and as entertainingly as I can without artificial means of tricking for interest. Though I do resort to sustained suspense in the body of the tale as well as bring in obstacles and the like much as we encounter them every day in our efforts.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Eugene P. Lyle, Jr.</b>: I'm afraid my mind is centered mostly on the story itself and I'm not thinking of the reader. Get a good story clearly told and you needn't bother about the reader; he'll do the reading all right.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Rose Macaulay</b>: Both.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Crittenden Marriott</b>: On the story. I write a lot to "get it off my chest."</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Homer I. McEldowney</b>: When I write I center my mind rather intently on the story itself, with my reader, however, parked on the side-lines. I don't forget that he is there. I believe that I am coming to give him a thought more often as I write more. Undoubtedly I take him into greater consideration in my revision of detail, reference and diction than I did at first.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ray McGillivray</b>: I do all my deciding in regard to market, and all the work of reconciling recalcitrant characters to the dictates of good taste (as best I can guess both) before a word is written. Never was there a fiction horse which ran well with either of these check-reins on his neck.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Helen Topping Miller</b>: When I write I do not consider my reader at all. I am concerned with my characters; I live, move, think and feel with them. Even in revising I do not think of my reader. I work hard for a true picture, and usually I find the reader gets it, if I have felt it strongly enough.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page225" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 225]"></a> <b>Thomas Samson Miller</b>: Center the mind on the story, of course; but never let the reader—<i>and</i> editor—out of sight. Keep in mind certain peculiarities of editors, taboos of magazines, and, above all, take care to avoid offending popular tastes and prejudices, and keep in mind the average stupidity and that average human beings are non-visual and non-imaginative. At least I do so when writing with dollars in view. Sometimes—quite often, in fact—I indulge in truth and in beauty—in <i>art</i>, that is to say.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Anne Shannon Monroe</b>: I never think of my readers: when I write I am galloping ahead on a lively good time of my own: and when it is all finished, I hope it will mean a good time to some one else—but I am not particular about that.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>L. M. Montgomery</b>: In writing a story I do not think of all these things—at least consciously. I never think of my readers at all. I think of myself. Does this story I am writing interest <i>me</i> as I write it—does it satisfy <i>me</i>? If so, there are enough people in the world who like what I like to find it interesting and satisfying too. As for the others, I couldn't please them anyhow, so it is of no use to try. I revise to satisfy myself also—not any imaginary literary critic.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick Moore</b>: When I write I center my mind on the story—I live it and sleep it until it is done. It exists wholly, just as much as the Grand Central Station exists. It has to. I do not think of the reader then, with the exception of what result I want to get with every word, every phrase, every sentence. But when I see it in type, then I think actually of the reader—and shiver.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Talbot Mundy</b>: The story. Hardly ever conscious of the reader.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kathleen Norris</b>: In both writing and revising I never have anything in mind but the story itself, and the struggle to preserve consistency and verisimilitude.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Anne O'Hagan</b>: My mind centers upon the story and I <a id="page226" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 226]"></a> forget about the readers until the story begins to come back from the editors.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Grant Overton</b>: I do not think I ever think of my readers when actually writing. Afterward in reading it over I may think of them. I do not think of them very much anyway. I think of how I like it myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Sir Gilbert Parker</b>: On the story itself always, never on the reader.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hugh Pendexter</b>: I never have the reader in mind while writing a story. The story is as real as any news assignment I covered when a newswriter.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Clay Perry</b>: I believe the "readers" are absent when I write, unless a dim nebulous sort of personality in the back of my head which might be called "One," and represent my idea of the composite taste and judgment of an average, well-educated person, could be called "Mr. Average Reader" (or perhaps a little above the average). If a story is worth writing, it seems to me, it must absorb the writer, he must live in it, become familiar with his characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Michael J. Phillips</b>: I think the reader is pretty constantly at the back of my mind. He is always, though sometimes unconsciously, being taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Walter B. Pitkin</b>: When I write my first draft, I think only of the story I am telling. When I go to the second draft I tend to think of both editor and reader. This is only roughly and broadly true.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>E. S. Pladwell</b>: My mind is centered on the story itself. If the story is good the reader will read. I wish to cater to the reader's taste only in a general way; that is, I know that all the mainsprings of human life and drama are the same to reader and writer alike, and therefore a story which appeals to the humanity of a writer must automatically appeal to the humanity of a reader, in a general way, always provided that the other elements of a good story are present, such as plot, technique, etc.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucia Mead Priest</b>: I seem to have about all I can do <a id="page227" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 227]"></a> to keep my story folk where they belong. It is perhaps unfortunate, but "readers" are a negligible quantity—seldom in the count.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Eugene Manlove Rhodes</b>: Center on the story itself. Think of readers when revising.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frank C. Robertson</b>: My mind is always centered upon the story I am writing, except where some question of probability or plausibility arises. Right there I stop and work it out from an imaginary reader's viewpoint. Of course, in rewriting I have the reader constantly in mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ruth Sawyer</b>: On the story itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Chester L. Saxby</b>: I do not have the reader in mind. I write stories that nobody wants because they don't come out pleasantly, or for some other reason. That's because anything worth writing gets a hold on me as a subject for thought and I want to express it for my own satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barry Scobee</b>: On the story. Never think of the reader, unless now and then in difficult passages I wonder if the reader will grasp the meaning.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>R. T. M. Scott</b>: I have my readers always in the back of my mind, but just sufficiently to keep away from things like the war which editors are fed up on. (Perhaps the editors and not the readers are in the back of my mind.) Otherwise I forget the world or all of it which lies beyond the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Robert Simpson</b>: I center my mind on the story only. Subconsciously, I suppose, my future audience is being considered while I labor strenuously over revision.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Arthur D. Howden Smith</b>: Try to think only of the story.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Norman Springer</b>: My tendency is, of course, to think only of the story while writing it. This query uncovers a curious thing. Now, when I write a story, I have a tendency to ramble. The trouble usually is that I am too much interested in my character. I like to investigate his feelings and thoughts at much too great length.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page228" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 228]"></a> Well, I have developed a critic in the mind who works while I write. It is as though some faculty were standing quite aloof from me and the story, watching. When I wander into by-paths it checks me. Sometimes it doesn't, and I get into a mess. It is a faculty that is constantly getting stronger, and, like the fond mother, I have great hopes of it.</p>
<p class="indent">I've talked this thing over with other fiction writers and I find it's a rather common experience. Several of them told me that throughout their careers as writers they have been conscious of this slowly developing faculty for self-criticism while at work.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Julian Street</b>: I don't have my readers in mind at all until after the story is done—save that I always try to make things <i>clear</i> to a vague some one to whom I am telling my story. But in writing the story—the people in the story—are everything. I don't think of editors, either. I write to the severest critic I have inside me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>T. S. Stribling</b>: A "reader" never enters my mind. I never give a hang whether anybody reads it or not, or what they think about it so long as I can get past the editor and get a check. I want the check because I can't live in idleness without it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Booth Tarkington</b>: I don't have <i>readers</i> in mind—only myself as a reader.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>W. C. Tuttle</b>: I suppose that a writer should consider the reader, but I have never done so; it has always been a case of story first; feeling that, if the story is good, the reader gets the real consideration.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Lucille Van Slyke</b>: Your question hits upon the greatest snag in my attempt to write. I find it bothers me excessively to have to keep any reader in mind; it's a mental hazard to me to think of anybody that I know personally reading what I am writing—a perfectly childish stage fright. (I qualify this—I dearly love writing a story for a child.) I am scared to submit a story to an editor after I have met him—don't mind at all having it slammed at <a id="page229" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 229]"></a> fifty editors I have never met. Realize it's foolish and feminine and illogical, but it's so. But I do try to visualize a sort of composite reader when I am revising. Example—just now I am doing a year's ghastly potboiling—a thousand words a day six days a week for a newspaper syndicate. Each day is a separate short story, all hinge together—climax each sixth—larger climax each month with a bang at the end of six months. This is the most disagreeable writing task that I have ever tackled. It's plain deadly. But I never sit down to it that I do not lay aside my usual writing method. Remind myself of this: Whoever reads what I am writing now is a person in a hurry. I will have the attention at the most for not more than two minutes. Scattered or tired attention. I must literally jab. Short sentences, short paragraphs. Few adjectives and always the same ones when I mention a character already mentioned, so that I can save my regular reader's time. And I must write very carefully with extra clearness. This rubberstamping must be neatly done. Nobody has issued such orders to me but myself and I may be wrong, all wrong! But if I could visualize my magazine reader or book reader as clearly, I dare say it would be a very good thing for me as a writer. Only, I forget the reader entirely when I'm working on the thing that really interests me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Atreus von Schrader</b>: When I write I do not have my readers in mind. But I have considered them carefully beforehand ... also the editor to whom I hope to sell the piece.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>T. Von Ziekursch</b>: When I write the reader is an outsider and never has a chance. It is one of my biggest hopes to bring some fun and joy, some touches of life, some deeper thoughts to any who may read my stories; but I certainly never have and probably never shall give these possible readers a thought. I would write if I never sold a word of it. I wanted to for years when I never had an outside opportunity to get within gunshot of a paper and <a id="page230" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 230]"></a> pencil; I could pour out a lot of those yearnings right here, but what's the use? Now I am in a place where I can write, I am fairly young and, believe me, I'm going to it with both spurs working hard. My mind is unequivocally centered on what I want to write. I hope to find markets for it and readers who'll like it, but I'd write it just the same if I didn't.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Henry Kitchell Webster</b>: This question is answered, better than I can answer it here, in my contribution to <i>The New Republic</i> Symposium on the Novel, entitled, "A Brace of Definitions and a Short Code."</p>
<p class="indent"><b>G. A. Wells</b>: I consider nothing but the story. It is there to be told and I try to tell it to the best of my rather poor ability. The reader for me does not exist. It doesn't make any difference whether anybody reads it, other than a continual complaint of unworthiness of my stories would soon put me <i>persona non grata</i> with publishers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Wells</b>: Center too much on the story. Am breaking myself of that bad habit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ben Ames Williams</b>: When I write, my mind is on the job of writing. I never consciously consider either reader or editor. I try to tell the story in an appealing way. But if you ask me who I am trying to appeal to, I can't answer you!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Honore Willsie</b>: In writing or revising I never think of the reader.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. C. Witwer</b>: In writing, I have nothing in mind but the story. A wandering mind is fatal to good work. I think of the readers when I see my yarn printed and—when I get the mail.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Almon Wolff</b>: On the story, emphatically and always. I take the reader into account, in revision, to this extent: My final revision follows a reading by a friend. I'm interested in whether he likes the story, but only academically—I can't do anything about that. But I want to know whether everything is clear. I will take infinite pains in revision if a comment indicates that I <a id="page231" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 231]"></a> haven't explained something fully; if my meaning has eluded this reader. On that point I'm always wrong and my reader is always right—the fact that I can explain the confusion doesn't count. You can't follow your story, explaining every point readers don't understand.</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></p>
<p class="indent">A general tabulation of the above shows that of 111 writers (110 of whom are tabulated) 51 give no thought to readers at any time and that 5 do so for selling but not for artistic purposes, a total of 56.</p>
<p class="indent">Only 14 state flatly that they bear the reader in mind habitually during the first writing of the story; 11 do so to some extent, 5 to less degree, 2 for clearness only, 1 for technical material only. A total of 33.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who do not consider the reader when writing but do so at other times number 22—16 when revising, 6 during preliminary work.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who consider the reader at any time—during writing, revision or preliminary work—number 55.</p>
<p class="indent">During the actual writing those who do not consider the reader at all number 78 against 33 who do to at least some degree.</p>
<p class="indent">During revision those who do not consider reader number 62 (56 + 6) against 49 (33 + 16) who do. Remember that, through my error, to only approximately half the answers was revision made a specific part of the question.</p>
<p class="indent">During preliminary work there were 72 (56 + 16) who do not against 39 (33 + 16) who do. (It is reasonable to believe that if the preliminary work had been specifically mentioned in the question there would have been more replies on this point and, since all those who do mention it answer affirmatively, that a fair proportion, perhaps a majority, of the replies would have been affirmative.)</p>
<p class="indent">The answers as a whole seem to leave the question largely one of individual taste or method. A more careful consideration, however, will discover a common underlying <a id="page232" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 232]"></a> principle for all and, in doing so, go far toward clarifying our concept of "technique."</p>
<p class="indent">Literature is an expression: of what you please, but an expression. To "express" inevitably implies some one to whom you express. As one answerer puts it, one must always write to "interpret." No interpreting is done unless it is done to some one.</p>
<p class="indent">To interpret or express with no thought of those to whom you interpret or express, without knowing whether your message reaches them or considering means of insuring its reaching them, is a completely idiotic performance.</p>
<p class="indent">To say that art is self-expression answers the above by making the artist himself the person to whom he expresses or interprets. Such a performance, if established, seems rather unimportant in itself. Literature, or art, however you may define these terms, should be a thing of world importance. The self-expression of a lone individual, reaching no one but himself, would seem a mere ephemeral atom by comparison. Nor is it credible that most of our writers would continue to write if they knew no one would ever read what they wrote.</p>
<p class="indent">Would any of them? Yes. And if what an artist writes solely for self-expression, being found good in its creator's eyes, is then passed on to others, it was none the less written for self-expression alone. If he has written entirely uninfluenced by the thought or expectation of popularity, fame, money or any other consideration except the impulse to create artistically, he has undoubtedly written with no thought of other readers.</p>
<p class="indent">That is, with no conscious thought of other readers. But the fact remains that he has expressed himself, or interpreted, to some human understanding. By recognized human symbols, in accordance with commonly accepted human standards. In this case it happened that the human understanding to which he interpreted was his own, but that does not alter the essentials of the act. He himself is a representative of the human race and he can not <a id="page233" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 233]"></a> interpret or express to himself without interpreting or expressing to their representative. He is, however little he may think of himself as such, merely their proxy.</p>
<p class="indent">You will have noticed in the answers that many of those who do not consider the reader state that they make their own judgment the test, constitute themselves the sole critics, develop another self to serve as critic. In other words, this "other self" is made the judge of their success in interpreting to human understanding by recognized methods in accordance with commonly accepted standards. It is the writer's very own, yet it reduces to nothing more than his individual knowledge and application of human understanding in general—and of general human reactions, standards and valuations. It is altogether individual to himself, yet, like himself, it can be composed of nothing but the elements common to the human race in general, however they may be transmuted by his individuality. A proxy for the race, it is, in fact, "the reader." However strongly individualized, it is still a representative, a composite, a standard.</p>
<p class="indent">The writer divides into self and other self, into the writer in his strictly creative capacity and the writer in his critical capacity as adapter of his creations to the demands of the common human standards of expression and understanding. The two, of course, are inextricably combined and never twice combined alike. The writer may be conscious of their working hand in hand during creation, or may be altogether oblivious to his critical self until the creative outpouring is finished. But whether he be conscious or unconscious of the fact, the two are always present. For the creative self can create out of nothing except human elements and his critical self is his knowledge of human elements; the creative self can express to human understanding only through the critical self's knowledge of human understanding. And the methods by which the creative self interprets and expresses those elements to that understanding are not known to it from birth but are <a id="page234" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 234]"></a> taught to it gradually by the critical self as the latter absorbs them from life.</p>
<p class="indent">His self creates, expresses; his other self tells him how to express, is the adapter of his creations to the demands of the common human standards of expression and understanding—is his guide as to technique. His <i>technique</i> is his knowledge, or applied knowledge, of all that perfects expression, and his technique is altogether in charge of his other self, the proxy for readers in general. <i>Technique is wholly based on consideration of readers.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The other self, to serve as critic, guide and test, must be master of all principles, rules, formulas and methods that facilitate and perfect expression so far as the writer knows them—must be master of all the technique at his command. The other self can function without the creative self's being aware that it is functioning, but only if technique has been so thoroughly absorbed and assimilated that the other self can apply it automatically, working in perfect unison with the creative self or, if you like, having become identified with the creative self or taught its knowledge thoroughly to the creative self. To just the degree that his technique is not thoroughly assimilated, to that degree will the creative self be conscious of it—and, probably, distracted and slowed up by it.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible that all technique should be thus thoroughly assimilated and unconscious. A writer might as well claim to have assimilated all human knowledge of art, of human nature and, for that matter, of nearly everything else. He can not be entirely unconscious of even all the technique at his command, unless he has ceased to develop and fallen into using only what technique has become automatic through long usage. If he is really an artist he will know that, no matter how great his artistry, there is always more technique for him to learn and there will always be in his store of technique bits newly added and not yet unconscious.</p>
<p class="indent">And technique is wholly based on consideration of <a id="page235" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 235]"></a> readers. A writer can learn from other writers, but they in turn must, however little they may have realized the process, have built their technique, through their "other selves," their proxies for readers in general, from their knowledge of readers and of how to convey their ideas to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Dividing writers roughly into two classes, one class considers the reader more than he considers his art, playing for the reader's attention and favor directly, consciously, baldly. Still roughly speaking, that class may attain great popularity, but it is not likely to create literature. Its attention is on its tools rather than on its creating.</p>
<p class="indent">The other class holds first to art. It insists upon making its tools so much a part of the artist that he is not conscious of them. It shuts its eyes to other matters, concentrates on creating and produces most of what we call literature.</p>
<p class="indent">But this latter class must, of course, have its tools. To have them it must get them from somewhere, make them of something. The amazing thing is that, for the most part, it doesn't really know where it gets them, doesn't really know from what they are made nor the fundamental principles in accordance with which they are constructed. The proof of this lies in the answers to this question concerning the reader and to the questions concerning the imagination and technique.</p>
<p class="indent">The genius knows, whether or not he knows that he knows. But there are few geniuses. The average first-class writer does not know.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to compute the degree to which their art suffers in consequence. It may be a great deal. It may, in some cases, be very little, for after all, being human beings, they must have some kind of subconscious understanding of the general fundamental nature and purpose of their tools. But certainly their art does suffer, in degree varying with the individual, as a result of their lack of definite, clear-cut, conscious understanding of both <a id="page236" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 236]"></a> their tools and their process. For they are working blindly to this extent. If a writer adopts a piece of another man's technique or finds one for himself and if it proves to suit his case, there may be no loss in that transaction itself, but he has added nothing to his ability to select a next piece of technique with understanding discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the degree of damage to the experienced writer, the harm is tremendous in the case of the beginner or comparative beginner. He looks at the work of others and finds many tools; he turns to books, teachers and courses for specific instructions and has tools handed to him, generally by the clothes-basketful. Each is for a specific purpose and neither the tools nor the purposes are correlated in accordance with any fundamental principle. No one can tell the specific purpose of any tool of technique with sufficient fullness and discrimination to cover its use in all cases, and the poor beginner is given no fundamental understanding whereby he can make intelligent application as the varying cases arise in his work. The results, registered in the unceasing flow of manuscripts across the editorial desks of magazines and book houses, are pathetic. What would be the results in law or medicine or teaching if they were practised without conscious and very definite knowledge of the fundamental principles upon which their rules are based?</p>
<p class="indent">The present chief obstacle to successful teaching of the art of writing is lack of correlation of the rules of technique to fundamental basic principles. The rules of technique have no other purpose than to facilitate and perfect expression. There can be no test of the success of expression except the person to whom one expresses—the reader. Technique will remain a rather vague and chaotic matter, with a corresponding difficulty in learning it, until the reader-test is applied to its rules to prove their soundness and to refer them back to the fundamental principles which alone can give the writer an understanding that will enable him really to assimilate his technique and <a id="page237" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 237]"></a> to apply and modify a rule to fit each one of the myriad cases that will arise.</p>
<p class="indent">The answers to the next question and to some later questions of the questionnaire will give further insight into the nature and practical use of technique.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Answers</span></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bill Adams</b>: No course of any sort.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Samuel Hopkins Adams</b>: No technical course of any kind. Such books as I have looked into only served to befog my mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Paul L. Anderson</b>: No course in fiction writing; stringent course in the handling of words, in prep. school, college and since.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>William Ashley Anderson</b>: I have never "studied" short story or fiction writing in any popular form.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. C. Bailey</b>: I know nothing of any course of instruction.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Edwin Balmer</b>: I was in short story writing classes both at Northwestern University and at Harvard, and I do not think they did me any good; in fact, in neither university was my writing approved. The teachers encouraged models of the past; I was writing after present-day models and therefore was criticized. It did not worry me because I used to sell to newspapers my classroom themes, and I thought the newspaper editors knew more about writing than the professors.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ralph Henry Barbour</b>: I have had no classroom or correspondence course in writing fiction. I was born too early for either. I have not read—through—any books on the subject. I am not, therefore, able to judge any of these. I have my own ideas, though, on the subject of being <a id="page239" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 239]"></a> taught to write fiction. Being of little value, I'll keep them to myself.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Frederick Orin Bartlett</b>: I never, thank God, took any course in writing fiction. It might help some but I am sure from my experience with college English that it would have only made me self-conscious.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nalbro Bartley</b>: No. I'm very much against courses in writing, schools for authorship, journalism, etc.,—even if people do live them down. From what I have seen, it produces a sort of professional-amateur and we have so many of them just now and so few people doing the things which would, if they were inclined that way, make them ultimately write. I mean—you can't write unless you know what you are writing about and technique is a thing belonging to a desk job, something which can be acquired after you have either vicariously or otherwise been in the arena. Personally, I found being a cub reporter on a paper for two years, a special writer for two years and then—just going to it with rejection-slips as my own teacher and life my classroom the most satisfactory route.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Konrad Bercovici</b>: No, no, no, no.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Ferdinand Berthoud</b>: <i>NO!</i> I don't think even God himself could write a decent story from any classroom or correspondence-school course if He hadn't the background. I know a man who is a critic for the —— Correspondence School, and, from what I can see of it, the sole end and aim of his organization is to string the poor, deluded aspiring writer along and soak him for all he is worth. He tells me that out of over a thousand stories he went over during last year <i>not one</i> was good enough to hit a magazine.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>H. H. Birney, Jr.</b>: No course of any kind in writing. Am considering one.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Farnham Bishop</b>: Wrote my first school "composition" at the age of ten, my last one at eighteen, all in the same school, under the same teachers, who encouraged creative work, criticized sanely, and banged English grammar <a id="page240" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 240]"></a> into me in the good old-fashioned way. Wrote for and later edited the school paper. Also turned out a lot of wild kid stuff in collaboration with another chap, and illustrated by Dwight Franklin, for private circulation only.</p>
<p class="indent">My pal died just as we were about to enter Harvard together. His death, and a douse of purely negative and rather supercilious criticism from an overworked instructor in Freshman English took all the fun out of writing. By the time I began to find myself at Harvard, I was in the Law School. Failed there, swung over into the Graduate School, took English 5 under Dean Briggs, English 2 (Shakespeare) under Professor Kittredge, and a course on Milton under Professor Nielson—all three the livest of live wires. Worked my way through an extra year just to take Professor Baker's English 47—the course on playwriting.</p>
<p class="indent">The school and graduate school courses helped me much more than the undergraduate work in college, mainly, I think, because of the difference in the personality of the teachers. I learned much more from the men—the pick of the men—who taught me than I did from the textbooks.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Algernon Blackwood</b>: No. I began writing at the age of thirty-six because I could not keep it back. I preferred an evening thus engaged to any pleasure, social, theatre, music or anything else. After a day of hard, uncongenial business, the imaginative release on paper was my real recreation.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Max Bonter</b>: I have never read any literature on fiction writing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Katharine Holland Brown</b>: Some classroom work, which was very valuable in elementary work. And, too, the classroom insistence on system and unity and all the virtues has always been valuable—when it has been heeded.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>F. R. Buckley</b>: I once took half a course (at the age of eighteen)—in short story writing (at a university). I had already written and sold several yarns. That half-course <a id="page241" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[pg 241]"></a> killed me dead for five years. I was self-conscious, and instead of telling a story I was inclined to wonder whether the climacteric was all right, or if the anti-climax had been put out-of-doors for the night. I now avoid anybody who wants to talk nomenclature as being much more harmful than the devil, and inexpressibly worse company.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Prosper Buranelli</b>: I read two books on short story writing. Got a couple of very elementary ideas. Got practical training writing Sunday stories under a discerning editor. That counted. If a plumber serves an apprenticeship to learn his trade—is a writer's craft any less exacting in the matter of skill?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thompson Burtis</b>: I have never had a course on writing fiction. I have read one book on it. All the help I ever got from it, as far as I can remember, is to have it impressed on my mind that a story must build up to a climax, which I believe I knew before. I had sold stories before I ever read the book. However, I believed it helped me a little at the start. Beyond the elementary stages, I can not see how it has helped me at all.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>George M. A. Cain</b>: Never took any such courses. Never learned anything from a book on the subject. I am strong for the idea of a correspondence school of writing, financed by publishers, free to pupils, handled by a man or men of real editorial experience or wide variety in authorship, ready and willing to be brutally frank with the hopeless, and capable of pointing out certain technical facts to those who can submit something of promise. Such a fact I am going to mention under XI. I do not see how any outside help can carry beyond the most elementary stages of actual writing for publication, unless it might be in the "trade journal" line of market information.</p>
