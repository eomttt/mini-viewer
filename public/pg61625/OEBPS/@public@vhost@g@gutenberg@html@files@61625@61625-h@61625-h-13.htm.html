Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part<br/>of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br/>concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,<br/>and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive<br/>specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this<br/>eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook<br/>for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,<br/>performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given<br/>away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks<br/>not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the<br/>trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.<br/><br/>START: FULL LICENSE<br/><br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK<br/><br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at<br/>www.gutenberg.org/license.<br/><br/>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/><br/>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or<br/>destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your<br/>possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound<br/>by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the<br/>person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph<br/>1.E.8.<br/><br/>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See<br/>paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this<br/>agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.<br/><br/>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the<br/>Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection<br/>of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual<br/>works in the collection are in the public domain in the United<br/>States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the<br/>United States and you are located in the United States, we do not<br/>claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,<br/>displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as<br/>all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope<br/>that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting<br/>free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily<br/>comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the<br/>same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when<br/>you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are<br/>in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,<br/>check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this<br/>agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,<br/>distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any<br/>other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no<br/>representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any<br/>country outside the United States.<br/><br/>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:<br/><br/>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other<br/>immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear<br/>prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work<br/>on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,<br/>performed, viewed, copied or distributed:<br/><br/>  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and<br/>  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no<br/>  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it<br/>  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this<br/>  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the<br/>  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you<br/>  are located before using this ebook.<br/><br/>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is<br/>derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not<br/>contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the<br/>copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in<br/>the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are<br/>redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project<br/>Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply<br/>either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or<br/>obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.<br/><br/>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any<br/>additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms<br/>will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works<br/>posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the<br/>beginning of this work.<br/><br/>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this<br/>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.<br/><br/>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this<br/>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without<br/>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with<br/>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License.<br/><br/>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,<br/>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including<br/>any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access<br/>to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format<br/>other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official<br/>version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site<br/>(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense<br/>to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means<br/>of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain<br/>Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the<br/>full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.<br/><br/>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,<br/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works<br/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.<br/><br/>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing<br/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>provided that<br/><br/>* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from<br/>  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method<br/>  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed<br/>  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has<br/>  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project<br/>  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid<br/>  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are<br/>  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty<br/>  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project<br/>  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in<br/>  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg<br/>  Literary Archive Foundation."<br/><br/>* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies<br/>  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he<br/>  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all<br/>  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue<br/>  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>  works.<br/><br/>* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of<br/>  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the<br/>  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of<br/>  receipt of the work.<br/><br/>* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free<br/>  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.<br/><br/>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than<br/>are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing<br/>from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The<br/>Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.<br/><br/>1.F.<br/><br/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread<br/>works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may<br/>contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate<br/>or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br/>intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or<br/>other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or<br/>cannot be read by your equipment.<br/><br/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal<br/>fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGE.<br/><br/>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium<br/>with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you<br/>with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in<br/>lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person<br/>or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second<br/>opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If<br/>the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing<br/>without further opportunities to fix the problem.<br/><br/>1.F.4.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of<br/>damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement<br/>violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the<br/>agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or<br/>limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or<br/>unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the<br/>remaining provisions.<br/><br/>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in<br/>accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the<br/>production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,<br/>including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of<br/>the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this<br/>or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or<br/>additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any<br/>Defect you cause.<br/><br/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of<br/>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It<br/>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations<br/>from people in all walks of life.<br/><br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br/>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future<br/>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see<br/>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at<br/>www.gutenberg.org<br/><br/><br/><br/>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br/><br/>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit<br/>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the<br/>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal<br/>Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification<br/>number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by<br/>U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.<br/><br/>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the<br/>mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its<br/>volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous<br/>locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt<br/>Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to<br/>date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and<br/>official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact<br/><br/>For additional contact information:<br/><br/>    Dr. Gregory B. Newby<br/>    Chief Executive and Director<br/>    gbnewby@pglaf.org<br/><br/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br/>Literary Archive Foundation<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br/>status with the IRS.<br/><br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br/>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br/>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND<br/>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular<br/>state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br/>approach us with offers to donate.<br/><br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br/>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br/><br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br/>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To<br/>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.<br/><br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be<br/>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and<br/>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of<br/>volunteer support.<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in<br/>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not<br/>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper<br/>edition.<br/><br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search<br/>facility: www.gutenberg.org<br/><br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>
