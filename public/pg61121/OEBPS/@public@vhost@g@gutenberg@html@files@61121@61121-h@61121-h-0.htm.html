Clarion and trumpet, lo! I bid thee come!<br/>
Blow up, tin horn, twang, <i>harp of unbelievers!</i>[<a id="chap00bfn1text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap00bfn1" class="pginternal">1</a>]<br/>
Bring me your aid, ye marrow bones and cleavers!<br/>
Strike up at once, to celebrate this day!<br/>
Who'd not be jolly, and who'd not be gay?<br/>
I little thought such happy times to see,<br/>
Such bliss, such joys, a sheriff's <i>Ma</i> to be!<br/>
Is't true? can such felicity be mine?<br/>
It glads me more than all my currant wine![<a id="chap00bfn2text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap00bfn2" class="pginternal">2</a>]<br/>
Or do I dream? or are my senses flown?<br/>
It's very strange, and mighty queer, I own,<br/>
But yet I am, I must be, Mrs. Van![<a id="chap00bfn3text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap00bfn3" class="pginternal">3</a>]<br/>
If I ain't, who is? who, good Heavens! can?<br/>
I see my cupboards full, and running o'er,<br/>
With tamarinds, nuts, and many a luscious store;<br/>
There's my old chair, and here the oaken presses<br/>
All full of mildew and brocaded dresses,<br/>
Fashion'd in times of yore, when in the throng<br/>
Of dazzling courtiers, as they pass'd along<br/>
The palace halls, my grandam stood confess'd<br/>
By all to be most beautifully dress'd;<br/>
There's my old shay, and there the red-nosed Bob<br/>
Who drives me slow, nor tires with the job.<br/>
It must be true, I must be Mrs. Van,<br/>
The Sheriff's Ma, disprove it ye who can!<br/>
And ye, the crowds,[<a id="chap00bfn4text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap00bfn4" class="pginternal">4</a>] who various duties tend<br/>
In this our own snug circle at Cane End,<br/>
Dismiss your labours, and with mirth and glee<br/>
Bellow hurrahs for Henry and for me!<br/>
Know for your feast (for now no English sinner<br/>
Can e'er do anything without a dinner);<br/>
Fox-hunters, statesmen, parsons, 'tis the same,<br/>
And even sheriffs must partake the blame:<br/>
For rumour tells me, shocking to relate,<br/>
That at the "<i>Star</i>" 'twill be my Henry's fate<br/>
O'er the Grand Jury Dinner to preside,<br/>
And last, not least, believe me, pay beside.<br/>
Sure I have had the kitchen table spread<br/>
With mutton bones, and sundry pounds of bread;[<a id="chap00bfn5text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap00bfn5" class="pginternal">5</a>]<br/>
Water in plenty, and (though very dear)<br/>
Two gallons of strong treble X small beer!<br/>
Drink if ye can! the beer's so very small<br/>
I think there'll almost be enough for all!<br/>
Drink! sing! rejoice! but let the Sheriff's praise<br/>
Afford a subject for your roundelays!<br/></p>

<p class="poem">Who'd be a sheriff, I should like to know,<br/>
With all this fuss and bother, teasing so?<br/>
These three last weeks I've not had any time<br/>
To sleep in quiet, eat, or drink my wine,<br/>
Though 'tis but little wine that I imbibe;<br/>
'Tis sleep I love, past all the world beside.<br/>
My moments once were calm from nine at night;<br/>
My dreams were pleasant and my slumbers light<br/>
Till next day's noon; but now 'tis alter'd quite.<br/>
O Sleep! thou loveliest of the gifts divine<br/>
From God to man, would thou again were mine,<br/>
To hide the visions which for ever seem<br/>
Haunting my fever'd moments, of the team<br/>
Of <i>Waddell's</i>[<a id="chap01fn1text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn1" class="pginternal">1</a>] jaded, miserable tits,<br/>
Which, ere the rail had knock'd their trade to bits,<br/>
In the "Tantivy" once so gaily pranced,<br/>
When <i>Cheeseman's</i>[<a id="chap01fn2text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn2" class="pginternal">2</a>] bugle all our ears entranced,<br/>

Now the sad emblems of regretted days!<br/>
Of wigs and judges, barristers and ermine,<br/>
Murders and felons, I can scarce determine<br/>
Whether on head or heels I rightly stand,<br/>
Wholly perplex'd, a very fish on land.<br/>
Swords and cock'd hats, with all my other dress,<br/>
O'erload my fancies and my brain oppress;<br/>
Where can I get a carriage for the judge?<br/>
To pay <i>Brown</i>[<a id="chap01fn4text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn4" class="pginternal">4</a>] thirty <i>Guas</i>,[<a id="chap01fn5text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn5" class="pginternal">5</a>] I own, I grudge;<br/>
What's to be done? A coach must needs be had.<br/>
A coach! but stay, the thought is none so bad,<br/>
I'll think me who, of all the people near,<br/>
Sport coaches, if I don't, whip me, that's clear;<br/>
The first coach-sporting neighbour that I know is<br/>
My best of friends, the worthy Squire Powys;<br/>
Yes! his will do, I'll ask for it to-morrow;<br/>
'Twill save me much vexation, toil, and sorrow.<br/>
But will it do? Ah, stay! I fear me no!<br/>
There's something whispers, "Van," this here's no go;<br/>
'Tis far too coachy, far too like the drags<br/>
Of which our noted Oxford builder[<a id="chap01fn6text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn6" class="pginternal">6</a>] brags.<br/>
Indeed, you'd live to hear the judges say,<br/>
"Good Mr. Sheriff! What's the fare to pay?"<br/>
Had you that coach; besides, there's Master Phil[<a id="chap01fn7text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn7" class="pginternal">7</a>]<br/>
To poke his fun, as well you know he will.<br/>
    Next the bold captain's cumbersome and old.<br/>
Old as its owner, Rattletrappy, cold;<br/>
'Twon't do! but now, I think me, Mr. Reade[<a id="chap01fn8text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn8" class="pginternal">8</a>]<br/>
Of Ipsden, he's the man to serve my need.<br/>
I recollect when I at Ipsden call'd<br/>
One day last week, with wondering gaze enthrall'd,<br/>
I spied his carriage standing at the door,<br/>
New lined, new varnish'd and new painted o'er,<br/>
Crests, arms, and all the proper blazonry<br/>
Pomps and achievements, known in heraldry,<br/>
Cushions well-stuff'd, well padded, and behind<br/>
A charming footboard, suited to the mind<br/>
Of any London "figure man" who clings<br/>
Behind the well-appointed coach, that wings<br/>
Its course down Bond Street, or the crowded rings<br/>
Of that proud rendezvous of fashion yclept the Park.<br/>
And what though arms and crest unlike my own<br/>
Glare on its surface? who's to make it known,—<br/>
No walking Gwyllim, Clarencieux, or Rouge Dragon<br/>
Infests our streets, to put an envious gag on<br/>
My borrow'd arms and crests. That I'll rely on.<br/>
One care's at rest;—but now my liveries claim<br/>
My next attention, and my thoughts' best aim:<br/>
What shall the coats be? blue turn'd up with green,<br/>
And smalls contrived of darkest velveteen?<br/>
Or green with blue, and (pray don't, Ladies, blush,)<br/>
Continuations built of crimson plush?<br/>
'Tis passing hard for one, unskill'd as me<br/>
In dress, and such-like senseless vanity,<br/>
Such things to settle—would I had a wife!<br/>
I never long'd for one so in my life<br/>
(Not e'en when Jessica's fair hand I pray'd,<br/>
And struggled hard, with anxious hopes delay'd,)<br/>
As now, to bid some gorgeous liveries rise<br/>
To grace my servants and astound the eyes<br/>
Of wondering freshmen, javelineers, and Dons.[<a id="chap01fn9text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn9" class="pginternal">9</a>]<br/>
I'll to my mother, she can best advise,<br/>
In coats and smalls she's wonderfully wise<br/>
(Who says she wears the latter <i>not</i>, he lies.)<br/>
When we've determined what the men shall wear,<br/>
Then in the shay to Letchworth's we'll repair;<br/>
He from his hoards of cloth blue, red, and green,<br/>
Shall rig out liveries such as ne'er were seen.<br/>
Such are my cares, and oh! I must confess<br/>
I feel much trembling and sad nervousness;<br/>
I've suffer'd much anxiety of late,<br/>
Dread are my prospects, painful is my fate<br/>
When I consider how the judge to meet!<br/>
Make a low bow, or fall down at his feet;—<br/>
<i>And then</i> my sword! 'twill sure be very queer,<br/>
Lest it upset me clean I greatly fear—<br/>
Powers of Impudence! assist, I pray,<br/>
Give me some brass, and teach me how to say,—<br/>
"Good day, your lordships, welcome to our city."[<a id="chap01fn10text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn10" class="pginternal">10</a>]<br/>
Of Oxford, now I'm Sheriff—more's the pity.<br/>
'Tis said, 'tis good, our griefs and joys t'impart<br/>
To kindly souls, and many a sorrowing heart<br/>
Where brooded hopeless, melancholy grief,<br/>
From sympathising friends has drawn relief.<br/>
May it be so with me! full many an hour<br/>

Could nerve me up sufficiently to fill<br/>
(The heart being sadly wanting, not the will,)<br/>
My Sheriff's office; even now a gleam<br/>
Of hope, though far, far off, is dimly seen<br/>
By my mind's eye,[<a id="chap01fn12text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn12" class="pginternal">12</a>] new light within me burns,<br/>
Some welcome sprite my fear to courage turns,<br/>
Makes glad my heart, and bids my spirits rise!<br/>
What ho! within, some brandy and mince pies!<br/>
Uncork a bottle of that curious wine<br/>
Which once belonged to that grandfather mine<br/>
Who first from Holland, settled at Cane End.<br/>
Bring up, I say, a bottle! pray luck send<br/>
It be a good one! for 'tis true enough<br/>
It's either quite tip-top, or horrid stuff,<br/>
Like Thoyt's horse,[<a id="chap01fn13text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn13" class="pginternal">13</a>] of which I knowledge had<br/>
Extremely good, or else extremely bad!<br/>
Here is a bottle! ah! 'tis wondrous kind,<br/>
Brilliant and sparkling, suited to the mind<br/>
Of more than sheriff, aldermanic quite!<br/>
I'll floor the bottle, then I'll say, "Good night"[<a id="chap01fn14text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn14" class="pginternal">14</a>]<br/></p>

Yet linger'd there, and gaped and wonder'd still;<br/>
As when in passing some secluded square,<br/>
I've seen a crowd of ragged urchins stare<br/>
With all attention and uplifted gaze<br/>
At a small theatre, covered with green baize,<br/>
Where Punch performs, with most discordant squeak,<br/>
His merry antics; now on gibbet's peak<br/>
Hanging (the rogue) the constable on high;<br/>
Now whopping Judy, whose most piteous cry<br/>
Rings through the square and stops the passers by—<br/>

SENIOR. Pickwick.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="poem">Hark to the clatter of the knives and forks,<br/>
In go the corkscrews and out come the corks,<br/>
Head waiter Smith bends 'neath a ponderous dish,<br/>
One hopes a salmon, or some weightier fish,<br/>
May be a turbot or a royal sturgeon—<br/>
The very thing one's appetite to urge on;<br/>
Covers of every size bedeck the feast,<br/>
The host has lots of "plate" to say the least;<br/>
It may be <i>plated</i>, though, 'tis hard to know<br/>
The real from sham, one does get puzzled so<br/>
By new inventions—here's albata plate,<br/>
Electro silver, numerous plans of late<br/>
Beguile the senses of the wondering guest,<br/>
And palm off drugs as equal to the best.<br/>
But to the dinner; one would think, forsooth,<br/>
'Twould be a banquet worthy of the tooth<br/>
Of any a city gourmand; wait a minute,<br/>
Look at that dish, and mark ye what's there in it;<br/>
It seem'd to promise turbot or a sturgeon,<br/>
And lo! what's there? a pike set round with gudgeon!<br/>
Its vis-à-vis contains a bit of beef<br/>
Cut from a cow, that died last week of grief,<br/>
At hearing of Sir Robert's new tariff.<br/>
A brace of sickly chickens, tough and dried,<br/>
Usurp the centre, flank'd on either side<br/>
By bad potatoes, baked, boil'd, roast and fried.<br/>
I'd most forgot a piece of veal and ham—<br/>
Try it—I'll bet a crown there's no one can.<br/>
Such, with a few disgusting tarts and pies,<br/>
Some cheese of which, at every mouthful, dies<br/>
A host of ugly vermin; such your bill<br/>
Of foul I call it—call it what you will.<br/>
Off with the cloth! don't let a trace remain<br/>
Of this vile medley. Off! I say again.<br/>
Oh, Mr. Griffith,[<a id="chap02bfn1text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap02bfn1" class="pginternal">1</a>] take a friend's advice,<br/>
Give the best dinner where you charge best price;<br/>
'Twould be far better for your credit's sake,<br/>
As for your conscience; that, old Nick may take,<br/>
If he will have it, which I greatly doubt,<br/>
You are far too clever, he has found you out.<br/>
Who's on his legs; hurrah, 'tis honest John,[<a id="chap02bfn2text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap02bfn2" class="pginternal">2</a>]<br/>
That Fane of Fanes! What topic is he on;<br/>
Hark, let us listen! What on earth's he at?<br/>
He means some fun, rest well assured of that;<br/>
Gazing around, with mirth-creating grin,<br/>
Says he, "My friends, I scarce know where begin,<br/>
I am so modest, spare my youthful blushes,<br/>
I'm yet a colt and have not cut my tushes.<br/>
I beg permission to propose a toast.<br/>
Such as I guess, just now will please you most;<br/>
Health and long life to that illustrious man,<br/>
Our now high Sheriff, worthy neighbour Van.<br/>
Sheriff! your health! and now with three times three,<br/>
And as you love me! let it bumpers be;<br/>
We'll drink his health, now Gents, your eyes on me."<br/>
    Finish'd the toast; High Sheriff! is the call;<br/>
Oh, dear! he looks just now uncommon small,<br/>
White as his choker, tho' blush-red by turns<br/>
With hectic flush, his quivering forehead burns.<br/>
At last for words he finds a labouring vent:<br/>
"I thank you, Gentlemen, with best intent<br/>
"To pay your kindness, with a due requite<br/>
"Of mingled thanks, enhanced with delight.<br/>
"As I am certainly not used to public speaking,<br/>
"And vainly now, for words of thanks am seeking,<br/>
"I'll cut it short, and with your kind permission,<br/>
"Seek in my chair an easier position."<br/>
    Round goes the wine, full many a toast goes down,<br/>
To Queen and Country, Albert, Church and Crown.<br/>
Some worthy Dons, wine-warm'd, propose the Bar;<br/>
The Bar, the Dons, and swear the gems they are<br/>
Of Oxford's glory. They, good easy men,<br/>
Can't twig the joke, nor legal satire stem;<br/>
And is it so? for half their mouldering lives<br/>
They sweat their Fellowships, then marry wives;<br/>
Or when in College, they have topp'd the tree,[<a id="chap02bfn3text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap02bfn3" class="pginternal">3</a>]<br/>
They drone and doze in dull solemnity.<br/>
    After this long digression we must try<br/>
Back to our Sheriff! What's this? Oh, my eye!<br/>
He's fast asleep, bad luck; in vain, in vain,<br/>

Thinks of some mode, to gain the wish'd relief.<br/>
Nought will avail! at last cries Fane, "Here goes,<br/>

<p class="poem">'Tis pass'd, and all is silence, o'er that scene,<br/>
Which of forensic eloquence has been<br/>
The fit arena; where with subtle brain,<br/>
Counsel have plied in nicely fitting train<br/>
Their logic's art, or press'd their rhetoric's aid<br/>
This to convince, the other to persuade<br/>
A doubting jury, where with anxious care,<br/>
Lest they in vain Justitia's sword should bear,<br/>
The upright guardians of our country's laws,<br/>
With practised eye, in each successive cause,<br/>
Watching the varying points, the tangled clue<br/>
Of facts explaining to the jury's view,<br/>
Have shown their power, unsullied to maintain<br/>
The sway of Justice, in her peaceful reign.<br/>
Can it be fitting, think ye, e'er to bend<br/>

Of fellow creatures! There in loathsome cell<br/>
A wretched felon counts each passing bell<br/>
That marks the hours, as in their noiseless speed<br/>
They near the fatal morn, and bid him heed<br/>
His soul's salvation, ere that sun shall rise,<br/>
Which last on earth shall meet his dying eyes.<br/>
Say, can ye still unfeelingly forbear<br/>
To shed for pity's sake one sorrowing tear.<br/>
I know that youthful blood beats high to thread<br/>
Those mystic mazes, fairies love to tread;<br/>
This is but Nature's province, she bestows<br/>

Apostrophizes thus his Sheriff's coat:—<br/>
"O thou bless'd emblem of my shrievalty,<br/>
Perpetual witness of my dignity;<br/>
In which I've braved the concentrated gaze<br/>
Of wondering myriads, for the last few days;<br/>
How can I thanks sufficiently express<br/>
For thy assistance, for I here confess<br/>
How much I owe[<a id="chap03fn4text"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@61121@61121-h@61121-h-0.htm.html#chap03fn4" class="pginternal">4</a>] thee, when I lay thee by;<br/>
Thou at Cane End in lavender shalt lie,<br/>
Snug in a chest, secure from curious eye,<br/>
Save mine; and I whene'er the lid I raise,<br/>
Will laud thy virtues, and renew thy praise.<br/>
Now, on my pony, straightway I'll depart,<br/>
Lighter in pocket, lighter far in heart,<br/>
Back to Cane End; I fear my anxious mother<br/>
In rapturous joy her boy will almost smother;<br/>
But this I'll risk, and should the Fates prove kind,<br/>
Should they restore my long lost peace of mind,<br/>
In slumbers light I'll close my wearied eyes,<br/>
And doze in quiet till the next Assize."<br/></p>

The memory of the host lives in the author's mind. The hostess still lives, and long may she live. (September 16, 1868.)</p>

The Sheriff, on the contrary, would seem to hold that "the coat makes the sheriff."</p>

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound<br/>by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the<br/>person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph<br/>1.E.8.<br/><br/>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See<br/>paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this<br/>agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.<br/><br/>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the<br/>Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection<br/>of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual<br/>works in the collection are in the public domain in the United<br/>States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the<br/>United States and you are located in the United States, we do not<br/>claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,<br/>displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as<br/>all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope<br/>that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting<br/>free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily<br/>comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the<br/>same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when<br/>you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are<br/>in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,<br/>check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this<br/>agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,<br/>distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any<br/>other Project Gutenberg-tm work.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of<br/>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It<br/>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations<br/>from people in all walks of life.<br/><br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br/>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future<br/>generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br/>Literary Archive Foundation<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br/>status with the IRS.<br/><br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br/>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br/>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND<br/>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular<br/>state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br/>approach us with offers to donate.<br/><br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br/>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br/><br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br/>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To<br/>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.<br/><br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be<br/>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and<br/>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of<br/>volunteer support.<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in<br/>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not<br/>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper<br/>edition.<br/><br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search<br/>facility: www.gutenberg.org<br/><br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>
